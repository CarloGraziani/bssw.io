# Better Planning

**Basic Description:**  Strategies for planning in order to improve software productivity, quality, and sustainability.  

**Brief Overview:** While the CSE community is concerned with software quality and sustainability, the process of software planning is often ad hoc and incomplete, largely due to the unique characteristics of scientific software, which are not well aligned with mainstream software planning guidelines.  We provide resources to help teams with planning, while acknowledging that software requirements often change during scientific discovery.  

**Quote:** “Plans are useless but planning is indispensable.”  -- Dwight D. Eisenhower.
