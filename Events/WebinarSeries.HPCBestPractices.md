# Best Practices for HPC Software Developers Webinar Series

- Organizers: The [IDEAS Productivity Project](https://ideas-productivity.org/)
- Dates: May 4, 2016 - Dec 31, 2018
- Location: Online
- Event Website: https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/

The HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) webinars address issues faced by developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on high-performance computers (HPC). 

Webinars are scheduled on roughly a monthly basis and are available live and then archived for future reference. The event web site provides details about the webinar series, including announcements of upcoming webinars, a mailing list to receive announcements, and archival information for the entire series.

**Webinars are free and open to the public, but registration is required.**

## Next webinar: Modern CMake

- **Date and Time:**  Wednesday, September 19, 2018, 1:00-2:00 pm ET
- **Presenter:** Bill Hoffman, Kitware
- **Description:** Bill Hoffman, the creator of the CMake project, will give an introduction to development with modern CMake constructs. CMake is 17 years old and has evolved over time into the most widely used C++ build tool in the world. In the past 5 years, many new features have been added to CMake to make the creation of cross-platform build files easier. This webinar will provide best practices for development and maintenance of a CMake build system. The webinar will cover the “target centric” approach to writing CMake files. In addition, testing and quality dashboards with CDash will be covered. Kitware’s experience with HPC systems and CMake will also be discussed.
