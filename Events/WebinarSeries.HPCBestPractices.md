# Best Practices for HPC Software Developers Webinar Series

- Organizers: The [IDEAS Productivity Project](https://ideas-productivity.org/)
- Dates: May 4, 2016 - Dec 31, 2019
- Location: Online
- Event Website: https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/

The HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) webinars address issues faced by developers of computational science and engineering (CSE) software on high-performance computers (HPC). 

Webinars are scheduled on roughly a monthly basis and are available live and then archived for future reference. The event web site provides details about the webinar series, including announcements of upcoming webinars, a mailing list to receive announcements, and archival information for the entire series.

**Webinars are free and open to the public, but advance registration is required (individually, for each session).**

## Next webinar: Discovering and Addressing Social Challenges in the Evolution of Scientific Software Projects

### Date and Time: Wednesday, September 11, 2019, 1:00-2:00 pm ET 
### Presenter: Rene Gassmoeller, UC Davis
### Description: 
In recent years scientific software projects have increasingly incorporated state-of-the-art technical best practices like continuous integration into their development cycle. However, many projects still struggle to create and maintain an active and welcoming user/developer community, and there exists little documentation on what makes a scientific software community successful. In this webinar I will introduce my work — as a Better Scientific Software Fellow — to collect typical social challenges and potential solutions that arise during the evolution of a scientific software project. Aimed at current and prospective software maintainers and community leaders, I will discuss topics such as building and maintaining a welcoming community atmosphere, overcoming skepticism of sharing science and software, mediating between users working on conflicting topics or publications, and providing credit and growth opportunities for community members. Finally, I hope to initiate a conversation among project and community leaders about what makes communities successful so that we can learn from each other and improve scientific software development together.
