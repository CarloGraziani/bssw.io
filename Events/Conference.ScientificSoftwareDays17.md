**Conference Description:**  Scientific Software Days (SSD) is a successful regional conference that has been held for eight years running at the University of Texas, Austin. This year we are seeking to expand the impact of the conference to a national scale. The target audience are users and developers of scientific software, and the goals of the conference are two fold:
- Share best practices among scientific software communities.
- Share the latest tools and technology relevant to scientific software.
