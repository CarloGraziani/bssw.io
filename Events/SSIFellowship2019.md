The Institute's Fellowship programme funds researchers who want to improve computational practice in their areas of work. 

**Description:** The main goals of the Programme are to help support improvements in computation practice and promote the results of these activities around research and software from all disciplines. We encourage Fellows to develop their interests in the area of software sustainability (especially in their areas of work) and aid them as ambassadors of good software practice in their domains. The programme also supports capacity building and policy development initiatives.
