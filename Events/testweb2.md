**Webinars are free and open to the public, but advance registration is required.**

<p>In recent years scientific software projects have increasingly
incorporated state-of-the-art technical best practices like continuous
integration into their development cycle. However, many projects still
struggle to create and maintain an active and welcoming user/developer
community, and there exists little documentation on what makes a
scientific software community successful. In this webinar I will
introduce my work — as a Better Scientific Software Fellow — to
collect typical social challenges and potential solutions that arise
during the evolution of a scientific software project. Aimed at
current and prospective software maintainers and community leaders, I
will discuss topics such as building and maintaining a welcoming
community atmosphere, overcoming skepticism of sharing science and
software, mediating between users working on conflicting topics or
publications, and providing credit and growth opportunities for
community members. Finally, I hope to initiate a conversation among
project and community leaders about what makes communities successful
so that we can learn from each other and improve scientific software
development together.</p>
