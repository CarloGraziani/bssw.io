### Abstract
<p>In Spring 2020 many workers abruptly transitioned from a primarily on-site to a primarily remote work experience.  Many people will be (or already are) transitioning to a hybrid experience, spending some days on site and some remote.  Working in this hybrid setting is likely to last longer for many people than the primarily remote setting.  For some, the hybrid setting may go on indefinitely. In this panel discussion, we learn from colleagues who have worked in a hybrid setting during their careers, as well as some who are new to remote work.  We will discuss some of the challenges we have faced in primarily remote settings and how these challenges might be addressed in hybrid settings. Themes will include making effective use of time on site, best practices and principles for teams who are blended remote and on site, and how to be effective and efficient in long-term hybrid settings.</p>


    


### Moderator Bios
<p>Ashley Barker is the Group Leader for the User Assistance and Outreach
(UAO) team at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF)
located at Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL). UAO is responsible for
facilitating access to OLCF resources, providing training,
documentation, and technical support to users, collecting and
reporting on user facility data, and acquainting the public with the
work conducted at the OLCF through scientific highlights. The OLCF
supports more than 1,200 users and 250 projects annually from a wide
spectrum of science domains. Ashley served as the National Climate
Research Center (NCRC) Project Director from 2014-2016. The NCRC
project represents a partnership between NOAA and DOE and through this
partnership, the NCRC team has delivered multiple computer systems to
NOAA, allowing the agency to advance its climate modeling and improve
our understanding of climate variability and change. Ashley is also
currently involved in the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) as the
Control Account Manager (CAM) for training and productivity.</p>
