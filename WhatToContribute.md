### What to Contribute Content to Better Scientific Software

#### Background

The [betterscientificsoftware.github.io](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io) repository is for collaborative content development on general topics related to [developer productivity](WhatIsProductivity.md) and [software sustainability](WhatIsSustainability.md).  

#### Content Categories

Content categories can include:
- **"What Is" document:** A document that defines terms and concepts in a particular topic area.  For example, the article could describe terms and concepts related to automated testing.  This kind of document is often helpful as background for "How To" documents that describe testing processes.
- **"How To" document:** A document that describes a process for improving producitivity and sustainability.
- **Original experience:** An original article (brevity is appreciated) for informing the computational science and engineering (CSE) community about how to improve developer productivity and software sustainability.
- **Curated links:** A brief article that highlights other web-based articles or content.  Your article should describe why the CSE community might find value in the linked content.

#### Content Scope

The exact scope of relevant content will evolve as we learn about community interests.  However, presently we believe the following guidelines should be useful:
#### In-scope Content
- General productivity and sustainability that overlaps with common challenges faced in the CSE software community.
- General tools that can be widely used by CSE developers.
- Characterization of challenges and solutions that may be particularly valuable to the CSE community.

#### Out-of-scope Content
- Narrow scope, focused on a particular CSE subcommunity.
- Tools, processes and practices that have little in common with CSE.
