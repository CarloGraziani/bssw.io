### What to Contribute: Content for Better Scientific Software

#### Background

The BSSw website focusses on general topics related to [developer productivity](Articles/WhatIsProductivity.md) and [software sustainability](Articles/WhatIsSustainability.md).  

Developer productivity and software sustainability efforts for computational science and engineering (CSE) benefit from communicating the experiences, reasoned insights, and curated content from a broad spectrum of community members.

#### Content Types
<!-- ### Content Types (look at blog articles for reference)-->

We solicit the following types of content from our readers and our CSE community.

<!---

- **"What Is" document:** This is a simple document that defines terms and concepts in a particular topic area.  For example, the article could describe terms and concepts related to automated testing.  This kind of document is often helpful as background for "How To" documents that describe testing processes.
  - folder: [Articles](Articles/README.md)
- **"How To" document:** A document that describes a process for improving productivity and sustainability.
  - folder: [Articles](Articles/README.md)
- **Original experience:** An original article (brevity is appreciated) to inform the CSE community about how to improve developer productivity and software sustainability.
  - folder: [Articles](Articles/README.md)
  
-->
- **Blog article:** A blog is an original article in the form of a blog of 250 - 500 words.  We will solicit contributions from thought leaders in the community and welcome proposals from anyone.
 <!--  - folder: [Articles/Blog](Articles/Blog/README.md) -->

- **Curated articles:** A brief article that highlights other web-based articles or content.  Your article should describe why the CSE community might find value in the linked content.
<!-- - folder: [CuratedContent](CuratedContent/README.md) -->

<!--
- **Event:** An event content is a brief description of an event (such as a workshop, conference, or tutorial) relevant to better scientific software.
 - folder: [Events](Events/README.md)

#### Scope of the content
The exact scope of the above content is work in progress as we learn about our community interests.  However, presently we believe the following guidelines should be useful:

##### In-scope Content
- General issues in productivity and sustainability that overlap with common challenges faced in the CSE software community.
- General tools for productivity and sustainability that can be widely used by CSE developers.
- Characterization of challenges and solutions that may be particularly valuable to the CSE community.

##### Highlight Connections to CSE
- How your topic intersects with themes that are of particular interest to CSE, for example MPI, Fortran, C++, architectures, modeling and simulation.
- Why your topic could be of particular interest to CSE.

##### Ease of Adoption and Use
- Address how easy or hard it is to benefit from your topic.
- Address who would be particularly interested in the topic.

##### Out-of-scope Content
- Narrow scope, focused on a particular CSE subcommunity.
- Tools, processes and practices that have little in common with CSE.
- Content that is deemed incomplete or biased, as determined by the BSSW leaders.
