### Style Guide: Content for Better Scientific Software

#### Background

The [betterscientificsoftware.github.io](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io) repository is for collaborative content development on general topics related to [developer productivity](WhatIsProductivity.md) and [software sustainability](WhatIsSustainability.md).  See details on [How To Contribute](HowtoContribute.md).

Please follow these guidelines for naming resources and files.   Be sure to include metadata with each entry, as this will be used to organize content, provide filters, and support searches on the BSS site.

#### Resource Name:
- Brief, essential words only, nothing extra
- For curated content: Follow name of content (e.g., title of book, article, event, site)
- Filename:  Same as resource name 
    - No spaces
    - Cap for first letter of each word
    - Abbreviations:
        - Apps = Applications
        - Cse = CSE = Computational Science and Engineering
        - Eng = Engineering
        - Hpc = HPC = High-Performance Computing
        - Perf = Performance
        - Sw = Software

#### Resource Description:
- Concise paragraph explaining resource from the perspective of the CSE community
- Use links to WhatIs and HowTo docs when appropriate for background info
- Image file (e.g., logo) - optional (encouraged when this exists)

#### Contributor:
- Name of contributor, hyperlinked to website

#### Metadata:
- **Categories**: Specify 1 or more categories (BSS website interface)
- **Topics**: Specify 1 or more topics (visible filters)
- **Tags**: Specify additional tags as keywords for searches (optional)
- **Level**: Specify level of content
- **Prerequisites**:  Specify any assumed knowledge (usually Level0, Level1 BSS docs)
- **Aggregate**: Optional info for aggregating content to define a more complex resource
