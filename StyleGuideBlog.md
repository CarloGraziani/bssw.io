# Style Guide for Blog Articles

*If you're looking for guidance about other types of BSSw contributions, please see https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/master/StyleGuide.md*

## Publication and Announcements

Blog articles appear here: https://bssw.io/blog_posts and also are announced on the [BSSw email digest](https://bssw.io/pages/receive-our-email-digest) (monthly).

## Length

General guidance is 250-500 words, though this is flexible (some articles have been shorter, some a bit longer). 

## Source Format

We use Github-Flavored Markdown for blog article markup.  However we'll work with you at accept other formats.

A skeleton Markdown template for a blog article, which you can copy and customize is available at https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/master/Articles/Blog/BlogArticleSkeletonA.md

You can provide a pull request for the article in the appropriate directory of the repository: https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/tree/master/Articles/Blog

If you prefer to use another format, you can email the draft to the editor you've been dealing with.

## Images

*Need to say something about images*

## Editorial Process

Once we receive your draft, we'll run it by a professional editor, check that the links and images work as expected, and otherwise prepare it for publication.  If your employer requires an internal review and approval process prior to publication, please let us know.
