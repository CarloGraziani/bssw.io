### How to Contribute Content to Better Scientific Software

#### Background
[The repository https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io) is a specially-designated repository according to GitHub organizational policy.  The contents of this repository are automatically rendered as a website with the URL: [https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/).  For example [this file (HowtoContribute.md)](HowtoContribute.md) is automatically rendered at the URL [https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/HowtoContribute.html](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/HowtoContribute.html)

Any `.md` file written in [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) is automatically visible via its pre-defined URL.  Given the ease of content development using GitHub's online content capabilities, the ability to work with the website as a GitHub repository, and the possibility to create scripting tools that can extract, create and test content in this repository, we encourage contributors to the BSS project to use the following processes.
