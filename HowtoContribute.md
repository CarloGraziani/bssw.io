### How to Contribute Content to Better Scientific Software

#### Background
[The repository https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io) is a specially-designated repository according to GitHub organizational policy.  The contents of this repository are automatically rendered as a website with the URL: [https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/).  For example [this file (HowtoContribute.md)](HowtoContribute.md) is automatically rendered at the URL [https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/HowtoContribute.html](https://betterscientificsoftware.github.io/HowtoContribute.html)

Any `.md` file written in [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) is automatically visible via its pre-defined URL.  Given the ease of content development using GitHub's online content capabilities, the ability to work with the website as a GitHub repository, and the possibility to create scripting tools that can extract, create and test content in this repository, we encourage contributors to the BSS project to use the following processes.

#### Preferred Approach: Web based
1. Open a browser window pointed at the [Better Scientific Software GitHub site](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io).
2. Select `Create New File` or open an existing file.
3. Edit using [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown).
4. Select `Commit New File` at the bottom of the page.  
  - If you have permission, you can commit directly to master.
  - If not, you can create a branch and submit a pull-request (follow instructions).
  
#### Alternative: Clone/Fork repository locally  
1. Clone (if you are a BSS member) or [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.
2. Create a new .md file in your local repository, or edit an existing file.
3. [Add](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) the file to the repo (if new) or commit the updated file to your local repository.
4. Push the change, or create a pull request, to send the file to the main GitHub repository
5. If you submitted a pull request, it will be reviewed by BSS team members for inclusion in the repository.
