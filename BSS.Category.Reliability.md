# Better Reliability

**Basic Description:**  Methods for testing and verification to ensure that software is robust and produces reliable results. 

**Brief Overview:** Good software reliability helps to ensure the integrity of CSE research for predictive simulations and decision support.  Moreover, because software encapsulates complex functionality for use by others, the reliability of CSE software is essential for collaborations that involve the combined use of software developed by independent groups.  

**Quote:** “Correctness is clearly the prime quality. If a system does not do what it is supposed to do, then everything else about it matters little.” — Bertrand Meyer
