# Jenkins Continuous Integration
**Resource URL:**  [https://jenkins.io/](https://jenkins.io/ "Jenkins Homepage") 

As discussed in the HowTo doc What Are Software Testing Practices, automatic testing systems lower the burden of running software tests and adding new tests.  Jenkins is an open-source automation server that provides plugins to support building, deploying, and automating software projects. Jenkins can monitor the execution of repeated jobs, such as building/testing software projects continuously and monitoring execution of externally run jobs, even those that are run on a remote machine.
