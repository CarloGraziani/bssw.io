# BSSw Site Has a New Integrated Content Map

#### Publication date: July 19, 2019

The BSSw site has a new look!  We're enthused to release a new phase of the Better Scientific Software site, incorporating an integrated content map to facilitate navigation and learning.  

Goals of the content map are to clearly present resources according to six primary categories:
- Better Planning
- Better Development
- Better Performance
- Better Reliability
- Better Collaboration 
- Better Skills

And to enable navigation among information on various topics in each category.

We encourage feedback on this new functionality--and the site overall.  We also would appreciate reports of any difficulties you may encounter.  Please [contact the BSSw team](https://bssw.io/contact) with your comments and suggestions.  

As always, we welcome [contributions to the BSSw site](https://bssw.io/contributes/new). If you have experience or expertise that can help other scientific software teams, we encourage you to contribute an original article or point users to existing resources you find useful.

Many thanks.

The BSSw development and editorial team
