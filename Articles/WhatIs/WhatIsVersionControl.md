Version control systems are essential for managing changes to files in a team-wide setting and thereby keeping track of changes to software development project as a whole. 

The short document [What is Version Control](https://ideas-productivity.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IDEAS-VCWhatIsVersionControl-V0.1.pdf) provides a brief overview of Version Control Systems (VCS) and how they are useful in many projects (not just managing software Source code).  This document gives some important definitions and terminology for VCS and briefly outlines the popular VCS tools Subversion (svn), Git, Mercurial (hg), and CVS and how they relate to each other.  It also outlines the most common and helpful use cases for VCS tools.
