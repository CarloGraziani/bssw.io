# Keeping your Vision Fit for Years of Software Development

#### Contributed by [Mark C Miller](@markcmiller86)

A career in software or computing can involve years of staring at a computer screen for extended periods.
The consequences to your vision, which can effect not only your productivity as a software developer but
also your quality of life in general, should be taken seriously. Here, we outline key strategies for
_sustainable_ vision health. 

## Understand the Risks
First, know the risks to your eyes. Eye problems caused by computer work are generally
classified as _Computer Vision Syndrom (CVS)_. CVS includes a variety of symptoms such as eye fatigue,
blurred vision, double vision, dry or red eyes, headaches and/or neck or back pain. The single most common of
these is eye fatigue. The eye muscles tire of doing the work required to maintain focus on the screen. As we age,
this problem can worsen and may become particularly noticeable over the age of 40 because the lenses become less
flexible requiring more muscle work to maintain focus on close objects.

## Get Yearly Eye Exams
The next best thing you can do for your vision is to have your eyes regularly examined by a medical
professional; an Opthhalmologist or an Optometrist. An Ophthalmologist is best because of the additional years of
medical training. If you are fortunate enough to have vision insurance through your employer, take advantage of it.
By building a medical history of your vision, even subtle changes in vision health can be detected and corrected
early, often before they become permanent.
