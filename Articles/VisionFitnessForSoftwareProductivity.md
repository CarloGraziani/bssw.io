# Keeping your Vision Fit for Years of Software Development

#### Contributed by [Mark C Miller](@markcmiller86)

A career in software or computing can involve years of staring at a computer screen for extended periods.
The consequences to your vision, which can effect not only your productivity as a software developer but
also your quality of life in general, should be taken seriously. Here, we outline key strategies for
_sustainable_ vision health. 

## Understand the Risks
First, know the risks to your eyes. Eye problems caused by computer work are generally
classified as _Computer Vision Syndrom (CVS)_. CVS includes a variety of symptoms such as eye fatigue,
blurred vision, double vision, dry or red eyes, headaches and/or neck or back pain. The most common of
these is eye fatigue. The eye muscles tire of doing the work required to maintain focus on the screen. As we age,
this problem can worsen because the lenses become less flexible requiring more muscle work to maintain focus on
the screen.

## Yearly Eye Exams
The next best thing you can do for your vision is to have your eyes regularly examined by a medical
professional; an Opthhalmologist or an Optometrist. An Ophthalmologist is best because of the additional years of
medical training. If you are fortunate enough to have vision insurance through your employer, take advantage of it.
Many programs cover annual vision exams and a yearly perscription for _computer glasses_. Also, be aware that
[_computer glasses_](http://lifehacker.com/5980509/do-computer-glasses-really-work)
are different from _reading glasses_ due to the difference in distance the eyes have to focus for computer work vs. reading.
By building a medical history of your vision, even subtle changes in vision health can be detected and corrected
early, often before they become such that permanent eye-wear is needed.

## Monitor and Room Lighting
Avoid glare and or light sources in your field of view, even the periphery, as you look at your computer screen. For
example, avoid having your screen positioned in front a window. For most office spaces, the ambient light should be
about half of what the office lighting was designed for. Indirect lighting (off the cieling or wall) is better than
direct lighting because its more diffuse. Adjust your monitor brightness to match the ambient
light in the room. Use LCD monitors with high refresh rates (120Hz and above).

## Fonts and Color Schemes
For your terminal color schemes, should you use light text on dark background or vice versa? The web is full of opinions
and anecodotal evidence but lacking in formal medical studies with definitive outcomes. It may be that different color
schemes work better for different people or that routinely alternativing schemes may stave off eye fatigue.
One color scheme worth considering, however, is [Solarized] (http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). It offers both dark and light background themes and is designed to maintain good _selective contrast_ for _syntax highlighting_ used in various editors.
What about fonts? The most important thing about fonts is to use fonts that enable rather than inhibit
