# Keeping your Vision Fit for Years of Software Development

#### Contributed by [Mark C Miller](@markcmiller86)

A career in software or computing can involve years of staring at a computer screen for extended periods.
The consequences to your vision, which can effect not only your productivity as a software developer but
also your quality of life in general, should be taken seriously. Here, we outline ten topics to be aware of
that might help keep your eyes and vision fit. 

## Understand the Risks
First, you need to become informed about the risks to your eyes. Eye problems caused by computer work are medically
classified as Computer Vision Syndrom (CVS). CVS is not any single eye problem but a variety of symptoms
such as an inability to focus after many hours of work, eye fatigue, blurred vision, double vision, dry or red eyes,
headaches and neck or back pain. The single most common of these is simply eye fatigue. The eye muscles get tired of
doing the work required to focus on the screen. As we age, this problem can worsen and may become particularly noticeable
over the age of 40 because the lenses become less flexible requiring more muscle work to adjust focus.


## Get Yearly Eye Exams
The next best thing you can do for your vision is to have your eyes regularly examined by a medical
professional; an Opthhalmologist or an Optometrist. An Ophthalmologist is best because of the additional years of
medical training. If you are fortunate enough to have vision insurance through your employer, take advantage of it.
By building a medical history of your vision, problems can be detected and corrected sooner, often before they become
permanent.
