This post, the first in a series on the topic of better collaboration, introduces the idea of developing shared consciousness among and within teams as an important step on the path toward scaling the productivity of small teams to a large networked aggregate team, or a team of teams (McChrystal et al., 2015).

For many computational scientists, past success may have been achieved by working shoulder-to-shoulder on small, trusted teams (e.g.  professor, collaborating students and postdocs, or a modest sized research group) that rapidly innovated, prototyped, and delivered. In a December 2017 Better Scientific Software post, (What Are Strategies for More Effective Teams?) McInnes asserts that “increasingly prevalent as CSE teams work toward next-generation challenges in predictive science are aggregate teams, composed of multiple successful previously existing teams, where software is a primary means of collaboration.” These aggregate teams are often distributed across organizations, physical locations, time zones, language communities, and cultures. As such, it can be a challenge to foster successful collaboration in larger, distributed teams. 
In our own projects we have been exploring ways to apply lessons learned from the book, “Team of Teams: New Rules for Engagement in a Complex World” by retired US Army General Stanley McChrystal and others (2015). The authors describe a team of teams as a network of coordinated teams who are interdependent and share trust as well as an awareness of a common purpose, and goal. This connectivity of common purpose, trust, awareness of each other, and transparent communication is referred to as shared consciousness (McCrystal et al., 2015). We don’t have to be in project management or a formal leadership role to help our teams reach across rigid organizational structures to achieve shared consciousness. 
We believe shared consciousness among teams can enhance organizational productivity and facilitate innovation critical to achieving an integrated exascale vision. Whether we are co-located or distributed, post docs, team members, or group leaders, we can all participate in reaching an integrated exascale vision together. Below we summarize three strategies from the authors to help us get started toward developing shared consciousness in our programs.
