### The importance of keeping work surfaces clean
Keeping our work areas clean is always a good practice but even more so now to
help stem the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (**note**: *SARS-CoV-2* is the name of the virus
whereas *COVID-19* is the name of the disease it causes).<sup>[2],[9]</sup> There
are some simple things you can do, and if we all are diligent those things can have
a big impact on how the next several months play out for everyone.<sup>[45]</sup>

Current guidance from the CDC<sup>[1]</sup> is ...

> It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19<sup>[9]</sup> by touching a surface or
object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or
possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the *main* way the virus spreads.

While surface contact may not be the *main way the virus spreads*, multiple
sources<sup>[3],[4],[5]</sup> suggest various *strains* of Coronaviruses<sup>[8]</sup> can
remain active in the air for hours or on different *surfaces* for days.
A pre-publication study specifically of SARS-CoV-2<sup>[4]</sup>
in particular concludes it remains active on metal or plastic for about 12 hours.

What surfaces do we need to consider cleaning? What cleaning solutions work?
How often should we be cleaning?

### What surfaces to clean? 

You should routinely clean, with a disinfecting solution of some
kind (see below), any surface/object in your work area you touch, even if infrequently.
Obviously, this includes your computer keyboard, mouse and monitor, as well as the desk area
immediately around these. However, it is easy to forget about all the other things
in our office areas we touch apart from our computer.

This cleaning guidance also includes your office chair armrests, telephone dial
pad, handset and headset, your mobile phone(s), your whiteboard and dry erase markers,
light switches, door knobs, coffee cup handle, eye glasses and even your badge.
If you tend to carry around a laptop that you set down in various places to work,
wipe down any place before you set your laptop upon it and wipe your laptop (bottom
and top) again after picking it up.

A really important piece of electronics
to clean is your mobile phone. Why? Many people set their phones down on various surfaces,
carry it into the bathroom and, of course frequently touch and hold it as well as bring
it to their ear and face. It's that
last part that is problematic. So, keep your phone, and the case/holder, clean.
And, maybe don't set it down just anywhere.

Ideally, you would use a different wipe each time you clean a surface. That probably
isn't practical. On the other hand, don't use a single wipe to clean everything in
your office area either. If you can, its best to use gloves when cleaning. But, since
most of us don't have easy access to a box of disposable gloves, just remember to wash
your hands after you've finished cleaning your office surfaces.

### When and how often to clean?

It is best to clean your office area just before you sit down for the day to work. 
That single time per day is probably sufficient for most offices. However, if you
work in a high traffic area or share your work area with others, you (as well as 
your office mates) might want to consider making a pass over all the items in
your office area a few times a day.

What about common access areas such as bathrooms, meeting rooms, elevators, etc.,
as well as the equipment associated with these areas? While it doesn't
make sense to spend your own time continually cleaning these areas, you may want
to carry some portable wipes with you to wipe the areas *you* will be using just
prior to your use of them. Alternatively, carry some tissue you can place in your
hand to push a switch or grab a door handle.

### What cleaners to use?

Some electronics are sensitive to common household cleaning solutions. Using the
wrong cleaners can cause surface discolorations or negatively effect display surfaces.
So, you want to take care that you won't damage your electronics but will nonetheless
still do an effective job of *cleaning* the surfaces.

Take care to check with your local organization's health or custodial staff regarding
cleaning solutions and supplies. They may have specific products to use and rules you
need to follow.

While CDC guidance on the types of cleaners<sup>[6]</sup> that both kill the virus and are
safe for sensitive electronics is minimal, a number of sources<sup>[23],[24],[25]</sup> indicate a
solution of 70% isopropyl alcohol and purified water (which you can mix yourself in a pinch) dabbed
onto a microfiber cloth will do.<sup>[21]</sup> Other options include diluted solutions of
bleach or hydrogen-peroxide or vigorous wiping with even soap and water.<sup>[32],[20]</sup> In any case,
if you are concerned about possible
damage, of course test the cleaner in a small, unused area first and wait a few minutes for it to
dry to see if it causes a discoloration. If there is a noticeable residue left after using a cleaner,
use a new, dry microfiber cloth to buff out the residue.

Just a few days ago, on March 9th, 2020, Apple changed its guidelines<sup>[22]</sup>
for cleaning Apple products to endorse a 70% alcohol solution.

### The science behind the scenes

The whole point of simple actions like these and other social distancing<sup>[47]</sup> measures
is to help *flatten the curve.*<sup>[46]</sup> Health care systems can care for a slow and
steady stream of patients. What they cannot handle is an exponential-growth driven tsunami
of cases all at once. Under those conditions, a lot more people who would otherwise get
excellent care in helping to fight the disease are at much greater risk of dieing.

Its worth mentioning that members of our own HPC/CSE community are playing a critical
role in helping to track and fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 

  * John's Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard.<sup>[40],[42]</sup>
  * How China is using AI to fight Coronavirus.<sup>[41]</sup>
  * Forbes article on ways AI is being empoloyed to fight COVID-19.<sup>[43]</sup>
  * Using mobile phone data to track an outbreak.<sup>[44]</sup>

### Other things to keep in mind

For those of us who are either sensitive to household cleaning chemicals or simply want
to be more environmentally friendly, there aren't many studies or data indicating
effectiveness of *natural*, common DIY solutions<sup>[27]</sup> like vinegar, tea tree
oil or witch-hazel. During the current outbreak, it may not be the best time to experiment.

The guidance on person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is definitive. It
enters through the *mucus membranes* including the mouth, nose, and eyes.<sup>[7]</sup>
The average person touches their face 23 times each hour.<sup>[26]</sup> This means anything
on the surfaces you touch you will almost certainly bring to your face or to other
surfaces<sup>[29],[30]</sup> you touch.

So, apart from cleaning your office area surfaces regularly, keep your hands clean by frequent
washing with soap and water for 20 seconds. Note that
overuse of alcohol based sanitizer will likely dry your skin to the point of cracking
*creating* a new vector for infection rather than preventing one. Try not to touch your face.
When you cough or sneeze, cover it.<sup>[31]</sup> Remember, you are not only protecting
yourself but also those around you. The most vulnerable among us will appreciate your efforts
in slowing the spread of COVID-19.
