In March 2020, the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) project organized a series of ECP Community Birds-of-a-Feather (BOF) Days to provide an opportunity for the HPC community to engage with ECP teams and the community to discuss the latest development efforts. The BSSw.io editorial team led the community BOF on *"Cultivating Software Sustainability, Productivity and Quality through BSSw.io"*. This 90 minute community BOF was  a great success with over 50 attendees representing academia, national laboratories and supercomputing centers. 

Avanthi Madduri and Deborah Stevens, from the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/), interview Rinku Gupta. Rinku was the lead in organizating the BSSw.io community BOF and she also serves as Editor-in-Chief of the BSSw.io site.

**Avanthi Madduri**: Rinku, Deborah and I are hoping to learn more about the BSSw.io community BOF that was held recently. This would be useful for audience members who were not able to participate in real-time and it give them an idea of the discussion topics, results and any recent developments. Could you tell us what were the focus and goals of the BSSw.io community BOF?

**Rinku Gupta**: The Better Scientific Software website (https://bssw.io) has been gaining traction as a community-based resource for sharing information on software productivity and sustainability in CSE and related technical computing areas.  The  BSSw.io community BOF aimed to get the scientific community together to engage in discussions on how BSSw.io could help scientists and the community do better science. It was also an opportunity to increase awareness about some of the critical aspects of scientific productivity. Developer productivity and Software sustainability are two critical aspects of scientific productivity. 

Developer productivity directly impacts the output and growth of a team and its software products. Software sustainability impacts the future of the project, including technical debt, long term development and maintenance and influence. The community BOF helped in facilitating an open discussion to understand  the pressing needs, challenges, and potential roadblocks for software sustainability and productivity. Such a discussion also helps the BSSw.io editorial team to determine priorities for future directions in site content, usage, and contributions. Several members of the community also presented and discussed their experiences using the BSSw.io portal. The long-term vision for BSSw is to serve as an international community-driven and community-managed resource, with content and editorial processes provided by volunteers. 

**Deborah:** A lot of readers would like to submit content for publication on the BSSw.io site. Could you elaborate on what kind of content they can submit?

**Rinku:** We are always excited to receive content from the scientific community. The BSSw.io portal seeks content on topics related to developer productivity, software sustainability and quality. Our content is organized in three high-level categories: original articles, curated content, and events.  Readers of BSSw.io can submit curated contentâ€”pointers to web articles, websites, publications, and technologies, with a short description of why this would be of interest to the scientific community. This is useful because in the plethora of information available on the web, very little can be applied to the scientific environment and we are trying to focus on such useful information.  The original articles on the site are in the form of blogs and experience-based short articles. As compared to industry which arguably has several standards that have emerged over the decade for better software development and operations, the scientific field - which is research focussed -  does have unique requirements in terms of their software development, productivity and sustainability. But, overall, the community is pretty aligned with respect to the types of software being developed, tools/technologies being used, and even overall research environments. Hence, we have noted that sharing experiences about software practices, tools, and teams is tremendously beneficial for the community. BSSw.io also provides a running list of happenings and relevant events such as webinars, tutorials, panels, workshops and conferences. Since this is a community effort, we do depend and look forward to community members submitting events.

**Avanthi:** We know that you discussed the process of submitting content to BSSw.io, during the community BOF. However, could you please briefly describe it for us today?

**Rinku**: Yes, of course. During the community BOF, we had discussions where community members shared their experiences with focus on the submission process.  In particular, recent contributors like Elsa Gonsiorowski, Keith Beattie, Nasir Eitsy shared presentations and discussions about their personal experiences. 

BSSw.io is managed by the BSSw.io editorial team, composed of senior editors and associate editors, who are experts in their fields. We get contributions from readers all over the world. I should mention that the BSSw.io website has detailed instructions on [how and what to contribute](https://bssw.io/pages/what-to-contribute-content-for-better-scientific-software). All submitted content undergoes a review process.  Once an article is submitted, we assign editors who work with contributors to refine the content, before it is finally published. We keep all our processes and workflows open so that we can receive continuous feedback for improvement and growth.

Our submission process is managed using our GitHub repository. For users familiar with Git and GitHub, submissions can be made by creating GitHub issues and content is created and merged using Git Pull Requests. With users unfamiliar with Git, we are happy to work with whatever technology they are familiar with.

**Deborah:** I undertand there were several focussed topic discussions that took place at BSSw.io community BOF. Could you talk a bit about them?

**Rinku**: During the BOF, we had several breakout sessions ranging from a hands-on session on writing your first BSSw.io content, community discussions on what topics would be suitable for the BSSw.io-like portal as well as a discussion on existing resources for software sustainability and productivity. Even though we had 90 minutes, the audience did manage to cover a broad range of topics. Some of the topics focussed on:

* **The need for more awareness**: More awareness and focus on topics of software sustainability and productivity in projects, is needed, across the scientific community. Audience recommendations ranged from suggestions for funding agencies to devote explicit funding to these topics, having community BOFs at regular intervals, to showing public appreciation for teams who are already doing great on these topics.

* **The need for training**: Audience members discussed training available on these topics and shared experiences at their individual organizations. Overall, there is a need for more solid and scientific-computing resources needed for training. There have been efforts in this direction by the [IDEAS productivity group](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/) that conducts many webinars/tutorials; as well several efforts by the [Software Carpentry organization](https://software-carpentry.org/).

* **The need for tools and technologies**: Audience discussed what tools, best practices and technologies exist today that they have found useful for improving sustainability and productivity in their projects. These tools ranged from documentation tools, bug tracking, issue reporting, automated testing and continuous integration.

* **The need to improve team productivity with virtual working**: We all discussed what strategies worked for us to improve team morale and productivity, during the remote working times of 2020-2021. Several methods such as having virtual team lunches, coffee time, water cooler discussions, techniques to productively organize meetings emerged from these discussions.
 
**Avanthi:** How can our readers and community members can get involved with BSSw.io?

**Rinku**: Getting involved with the BSSw.io effort is as easy as reaching out of any member of the [editorial team](https://bssw.io/pages/team). We have tried to make the submission process straightforward and easy. We invite and encourage developers and researchers to share experiences and information with the rest of the community through BSSw.io, as the site grows to become a central outreach channel. We also have a mailing list, that is low-traffic and provides monthly updates about new content on the site - blog readers [can subscribe to it](https://bssw.io/pages/receive-our-email-digest). The [BSSw.io](https://bssw.io) site has comprehensive information on how to view current content and contributors, as well as how to [contribute content](https://bssw.io/contribute).  We look forward to working with your teams and the entire community closely.
