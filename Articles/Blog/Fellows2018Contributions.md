During their tenure, the 2018 BSSw Fellows used their skills – in code review, reproducibility, software citation, and modern C++ — to tackle scientific software development and sustainability challenges.  

BSSw Fellowships provide resources and community to those who foster and promote practices, processes, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes. This is how our 2018 BSSw fellows are making an impact on scientific software development.

### Fellows improve code quality

Even the most seasoned code developer can spend countless hours tracking down a bug that could have been caught with peer code review. BSSw Fellow Jeffrey Carver modernizes scientific software quality assurance by teaching contemporary peer code review in scientific software development through best practices tutorials and hands-on code review exercises. His tutorial includes a general introduction to code review, a more specific discussion of the unique nature of scientific code review, and an overview of available tool support. Tutorial attendees participate in hands-on exercises to practice code review. The tutorial concludes with a group discussion about best practices for performing scientific code review. Learn more about peer code review through his tutorial website (including slides): [Contemporary Peer Code Review Practices](https://se4science.org/tutorials/ECP19/), from the ECP 2019 Annual Meeting.

### Fellows enable reproducible computational research

If you can’t repeat your experiments and others can’t reproduce your results, did it make a sound? BSSw Fellow Ivo Jimenez created Popper, a tool to automate computational experimentation, organize artifacts and validate results to enable high standards of reproducibility in computational research. He created an online lesson on Popper and delivered several training activities to help domain scientists generate experimentation pipelines that are easy to re-execute and validate. Learn more about Popper through his webinar recording and slides: [Popper: Creating Reproducible Computational and Data Science Experimentation Pipelines](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars/#webinar019), June 2018.

Ivo is a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz.  

### Fellows give software developers long-overdue credit

Paper citations are tracked to measure impact, similarly software citations should be tracked to measure impact and recognize the significant time spent developing software & data. BSSw Fellow Daniel S. Katz developed principles for software citation to make scientific software more sustainable by providing credit to its developers, similar to research via paper citations. He led working groups to produce the principles, and is currently working with publishers on implementation to impact institutionalized citation practices.
