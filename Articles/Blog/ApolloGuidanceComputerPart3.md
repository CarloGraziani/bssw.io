*Third of a three-part series to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Moon landings.*

In the Apollo program, the *users* of the AGC were first and foremost the astronauts who
had to fly the vehicles the AGC controlled. In the lunar module, the computer's *Proceed*
button, the main engine *Shutdown* button and the *Abort* button were in such close
proximity<sup>[3]</sup>, it would have been very easy for users to hit the wrong button.
Fortunately, this never happened.


the users really had think carefully about hitting the right
buttons at the right times and not hitting the wrong buttons.

making sure they hit the right button(s) at the right time. 

I am reminded

While practicing guidance alignments with the space sextent on the return leg of Apollo 8,
Jim Lovell accidentally keyed in a pre-flight program, `P01`, instead of star `01` of the AGC's
star catalog.



One user nobody had planned for was Margaret
Hamilton's elementary school daughter, Lauren. Once while playing astronaut during a visit
with her mother at work, Lauren managed to key in DSKY commands causing an AGC simulator
to crash. The simulator was running an in-flight program and Lauren had keyed in a command
to select and run a pre-flight program. Alarmed, Hamilton's first thought was
*what if an astronaut did that in flight?* She investigated the cause and proposed a program
change to prevent such accidental entry. However, NASA believed the astronauts were so well
trained the would never make such a mistake and rejected the program change. 



This is the third of three articles about the AGC. In parts 1 and 2, we described the
hardware<sup>[1]</sup> and software.<sup>[2]</sup> Here, in part 3, we focus on *applications*;
that is the actual use of the AGC in Apollo missions.


We cannot write about how Apollo astronauts flew to the moon without using *verbs*
and *nouns*?

## Uncrewed Missions
Block I AGCs were used in 4 uncrewed Apollo missions designed primarily to test
the main spacecraft components and less so to test the AGC. Nonetheless, the computer was a
critical part of these missions because of the flexibility it gave mission planners and
mission control. For example, Apollo 6 was to be the first Apollo flight to perform
a trans-lunar injection burn. However, the main Saturn booster suffered serious
*pogo oscillations* damaging the upper stages preventing such a test. Using the in-situ
programmability of the AGC, mission control was able to easily adjust the mission plan
mid-flight.

## Wally Schirra
Among the astronauts there were widely varying opinions about how much and what kind of
control they would *give up* to this new-fangled
technology.

Wally Shcirra, perhaps the most automation-resistant, planned to manually
fly the re-entry of Apollo 7. But when delays put them dangerously behind on re-entry
checklist items, at the last minute he had no choice but to switch to automated re-entry.
With the AGC in control, Apollo 7 splashed down safely, on schedule and within 2 miles of
their intended target. After, Schirra couldn't stop singing the praises of the AGC.



## Apollo 1
Pure oxygen at 2 psi above atmospheric pressure, 5000 in<sup>2</sup> of highly combustable
Velcro and a spark in the electrical system lead to a horrendous fire killing the crew
of Apollo 1 during a launch rehersal. The subsequent pause in the launch schedule for safety
improvements gave MIT an extra 21 months to resolve issues with delivering flight-ready software.
In that time, under the relentless leadership of system integrator Bill Tindall, MIT developers
transitioned from *triage* mode to *optimization* mode.
