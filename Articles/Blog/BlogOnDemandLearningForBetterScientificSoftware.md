*In May 2018, Elaine Raybourn presented a webinar titled "On-demand Learning for Better Scientific Software: How to Use Resources & Technology to Optimize your Productivity" in the series Best Practices for HPC Software Developers on the IDEAS Productivity website. In this article, Elaine answers questions from her webinar participants about challenges associated with transmedia learning in the wild (i.e., as it naturally occurs in a social context). Transmedia learning is the scalable system of messages representing a core experience that unfolds from the use of multiple media and emotionally engages learners by involving them personally in the story. A transmedia learning framework (TLF) provides guidelines and heuristics for designing and personalizing your transmedia learning in the wild. Elaine is a scientist at Sandia National Laboratories.*
