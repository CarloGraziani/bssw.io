BSSw Fellowships provide resources and community support to those who foster and promote practices, processes, and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes. 

During their tenure, 2019 BSSw Fellows have used their skills to create tutorials, webinars, and tools to guide developers through various stages of thee scientific sofware lifecycle.  Here's more about what they have been up to.

### Fellows guide us through the social challenges of scientific software projects.
_Social skills matter for the development of user and developer communities._ 

BSSw Fellow Rene Gassmoeller created a series of guides and tutorials about managing the community around a scientific software project. Targeted at current and prospective software maintainers and community leaders, the tutorials teach this knowledge in small modules that are accessible to scientists. Thus, if you are currently leading or maintaining a scientific software project, or thinking about starting one, Rene's guides will help you navigate your scientific software project from inception to long-term sustaintability.
