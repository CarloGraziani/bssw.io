It is an oft spoken rule that students are the backbone of research efforts. Much of the work students do is extensive development and testing work critical for projects to make effective progress. By using some proven techniques to find and motivate students and then incorporating them into the team, the impacts students bring can be supercharged.

### Managing students
Finding effective ways to attract and making students productive requires a few techniques. A hands off approach may be appealing for a mentor's time management, but it may backfire. Instead, consider some guidelines about how to best engage with students of different levels.
No matter if the student is an undergraduate or a graduate student, there are a few techniques that can make finding and managing students both easier and more effective.

#### Recruiting students
Finding students requires carefully crafting a description of the job and what the responsibilities will be. The description needs to be intriguing as well as seemingly achievable. Writing these descriptions as a person long past their undergraduate days is a difficult task. Find students at the target level and have them review your posting and see what feedback they give. It may be surprising how many, “what does this mean?” and, “I don't know what to expect with this” sorts of responses will be generated.

#### Motivating students
College students, with rare exceptions, are motivated for delayed gratification and have strong skills in effort/reward trade-off evaluation. As part of an internship, particularly if a job after graduation might be possible, the students see the short term extreme effort as worth the potential long term position at a job they will love. Revealing to the student what that job will really be like is not always a consideration. There are other things that can be done to motivate students beyond the promise of a job.

#### Empowering
Few students before late in their PhD studies gain much authority over what decisions are made and control over what is done. One proven terrifying, but exhilarating, approach is to empower the student with full ''control'' over the project direction. As long as the decision is not known to be a poor approach, let the student pursue the direction. It may not be what the mentor would have done, but it may prove to reveal new insights previously not considered.
Active Mentoring
Daily short meetings are crucial to keeping track of what is going on and what problems are occurring. The Scrum idea of a stand-up meeting to keep it short is the right base idea. However, to make this effective, the meeting time may vary from 5 minutes to 5 hours, depending on the need. For example, If the student is heads down hacking code making good progress, do not interrupt the work to see where they are. Few things are bigger productivity killers than taking someone out of ''the zone'' to do some other activity. This also lets a mentor give the student a full day to work through a problem before stepping in to help.

### Incorporating project elements
Given effective interaction with students, potentially using techniques like those described above, finding effective ways to incorporate a student into the project is essential.

#### Reproducibility frameworks
While reproducibility is a growing concern, frameworks, such as the Popper Convention [1] can accelerate incorporating a new student as well as offering reproducibility features necessary for many research paper submissions. If the project is not incorporating these kinds of features, it is an ideal time for someone to develop the integration. The student can learn how to build and manage the project leaving the project in better shape once the task is complete.

#### Version control for everything
Version control systems long used for source code management have been used for many other artifacts in recent years. The ability to isolate changes and rollback changes to a known “good” point are key features making these tools generally useful rather than just source code management systems. If it exists, it should be in version control.

#### Assign meaningful tasks
If it is absolutely necessary to assign less meaningful tasks, offer a “when you get this task we REALLY need done, we want you to work on X” carrot. Students will understand the need to get through a tedious task and will work hard to get it done quickly and efficiently to get to the more interesting work. Remember that students want to have impact.

#### Make students full team members
Regular project meetings happen and students may or may not be requested to attend. It is better to spend the little bit of time to have students attend, if possible, to make them feel part of the team. Further, as the meeting leader, make a point of soliciting input from the student based on what they have done and seen. It may be minor and they may not be comfortable sharing, but seeing their opinions and knowledge be considered is a big confidence booster. That sort of boost increases motivation and productivity.

### Discussion
The goal of the efforts described in this article are to make interns more productive parts of a team and to increase the value of their participation. All of the recommendations are the product of my years of experience in mentoring student interns in numerous of contexts and projects. As team members, students make vital contributions to research projects, and positioning them for success benefits everyone involved. I have found that these strategies can yield happy, productive students with solid, lasting project impacts. As a researcher, every student I have ever paid has managed to develop sufficiently to generate a peer reviewed publication at an external venue based on the internship work. They have also left a code base, scripted tools, and full documentation about everything they did enabling me to build on their work for future projects. This includes four undergraduates students and six graduate students so far.
