It turns out that sometimes you do get a second chance! Recordings of the software-related sessions we organized at the recent SIAM CSE19 conference are now available online.

One of the things that we think is very important to producing better scientific software is sharing how we do it.  In computational science and engineering, most conferences, workshops, and journals are focused on the scientific results and  the algorithmic and methodological advances that help create them.  There are a lot fewer opportunities to discuss the process of developing the software.  So we, and others in the community, try to create opportunities for such discussions to take place, through workshops and focused sessions within larger conferences, as well as other types of events, such as "Birds of a Feather" sessions at conferences like Supercomputing and ISC.

### Software Discussions at SIAM Meetings

It turns out that some of the meetings organized by the Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) have been particularly good venues for such discussions.  SIAM meetings are largely organized by the attendees, who propose "minisymposia" on topics of their choice, consisting of up to four speaker slot per block (sometimes organizers will include panels or group discussions in one slot).  Like many other scientific meetings, SIAM meetings also include poster sessions.  But SIAM is unique in our experience in providing opportunities for what they call "minsymposteria" -- a topical group of posters organized together in space and time, similar to the talks of a minisymposium.
