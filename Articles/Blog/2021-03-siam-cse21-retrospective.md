The 2021 SIAM Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE21) just wrapped.  The meeting was notable for being the first CSE conference held exclusively online and for the largest number of registered participants in the history of the conference.  And with contributions from more than 60 different presenters, it also hosted the largest array of software-focused sessions the conference has seen to date.

The SIAM Computational Science and Engineering conference series has always been a good place to talk about *software*.  It starts with SIAM's "crowd-sourcing" approach to organizing many of its conferences -- the community is asked not to write and submit papers, but to organize multi-speaker sessions around topics of interest.  The organizers of the CSE conference series recognize the centrality of *software* to the practice of computational science and engineering, and they've always welcomed such topics.  While many workshops and conferences focus on new science, new algorithms, etc., at CSE it is also possible to hold discussions about the experience of software development and sustainability.  And this year, with the help of more than 60 presenters, the conversation around software was one of the most extensive we've seen.  There were seven software-focused "minisymposia", each including either five or ten speakers, as well as a topical group of posters, or "minisymposterium" put together by sixteen organizers.  For those who registered for CSE21, the minisymposia were recorded, and will be available through the vFairs conference platform until June.  **But for those who didn't register, we've collected the presentations and posters from these software-focused sessions to share with the community, and we'll link to them below.** (As of publication, the collections are mostly complete, and we will add the remaining presentations as quickly as we can.)

### Software Productivity and Sustainability for CSE

Collected presentations DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321423](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321423) | SIAM program pages: [MS30](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=70085)

This session focused on work that addresses growing technical and social challenges in the quality and sustainability of scientific software as well as the productivity of developers.  Topics included software engineering approaches for medium-sized distributed scientific projects, as well as strategies for continuous integration (CI) testing, performance portability, employing user stories to identify software requirements,  and workflow for improving software quality.

### Better Scientific Software Fellowship

Collected presentations DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321426](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321426) | SIAM program pages: [MS68](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=70202)

The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship program fosters and promotes practices, processes and tools to improve developer productivity and software sustainability of scientific codes.  BSSw Fellows are chosen annually to develop a funded activity, such as organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community that promotes BETTER scientific software. This minisymposium sets the stage by Hai Ah Nam, BSSw Fellowship Coordinator, presenting the BSSw Fellowship Program Overview, followed by four (4) BSSw Fellowship alumni sharing their work addressing a diverse range of scientific software topics:
*	Damian Rouson, presents his work Introducing Agile Scientific Software Development to Underrepresented Groups.  He describes his approach to teach scientific software development practices without the software.  Damian’s tutorials integrate a professional development activity (e.g. resume, paper writing) using agile practices to make scientific software development more practical and accessible.
*	Nasir Eisty, describes user surveys identifying challenges, barriers and potential solutions to scientific software testing used to shape his tutorial on Automatic Testing for Scientific Software Development.  Nasir’s tutorial addresses unsolved problems faced while testing scientific software, best practices, along with providing hands-on exercises to help developers produce correct and reliable software.
*	Cindy Rubio-Gonzalez, presents her work on Improving the Reliability and Performance of Numerical Software through tools and techniques focused on precision tuning for different architectures.  She provides a preview from her soon-to-be-public educational modules on Software Tools for Correctness and Optimization of Scientific Software to teach students and application developers how to balance code correctness with optimization.
*	Kyle Niemeyer, in his talk Educating Scientists on Best Practices for Developing Research Software describes the motivation and design of a modular course that teaches practices for developing research software to graduate students and other researchers, and his experience in teaching this content in various formats. Topics taught include local and remote version control, licensing and copyright, structuring Python modules, testing and test coverage, continuous integration, packaging and distribution, open science, software citation, and reproducibility basics, among others.

### Building Sustainable Software Communities and Sustainable Software

Collected presentations DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321435](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321435) | SIAM program pages: [MS94](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=70102), [MS125](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=70103)

### Exascale Computing Project Performance Portability Analysis

Collected presentations DOI: [10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321441](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5321441) | SIAM program pages: [MS162](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=69992), [MS192](https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=69993)

Exascale Computing Project (ECP) Performance Portability Analysis was a two part symposium that included presentations from several members of the ECP leadership team and from the Science Director of Oak Ridge National Laboratory Computing Facility. The MS was an offshoot of a series of panels that were conducted as a five part series during the summer of 2020. With its focus on preparing a representative set of mission critical applications for the forthcoming exascale platforms, performance portability is a top level concern for the projects, and its leadership has an unparalleled view of where the biggest challenges lie. The ECP is composed of three focus areas: applications, software technologies (ST), and hardware and integration (HI) . Each of the focus area is subdivided into portfolios that group together software with similar domains, features, or challenges. Each portfolio has one member of the leadership team assigned to it. The MS started with a computing facility perspective on preparing for performance portability in presence of heterogeneity of platforms and programming models. Other presentations included a comprehensive overview of applications and their role in the project presented by the deputy lead of the applications area, a comprehensive view of math libraries and software technologies by the ST deputy lead, and description of their portfolios by the leads whose portfolios have to confront the issue of performance portability. It was perhaps the most complete articulation of performance portability challenges and ways to mitigate them for at least the next generation of platforms.

Advanced git workflows in the context of the Trilinos project were the focus the presentation by Roscoe Bartlett.  Jason Gates provided views on continuous integration testing infrastructure and an effort at Sandia Labs to use OpenStack with different CI testing frameworks.  Finally, Vadim Dyadechko provided views and perspectives on software engineering for CSE from his work on developing numerical simulation codes.
