**The use of social media such as Twitter in the context of scientific research may seem like a time-consuming distraction from more productive and rewarding activities, such as writing a paper. Are there any tangible benefits? How can we maximize those benefits while avoiding potential pitfalls? We've been using Twitter and other social media in a large research project and here are some of our experiences.**

I am the Principal Investigator of a large, multi-year, multi-institutional research project at the Pacific Nortwest National Laboratory. I finished graduate school around the time that the first web browser (remember [Mosaic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser))?) was released, and I got into the internet revolution on the ground floor. So I just dated myself, but anyway... Today as the senior researcher on the project, I find myself surrounded by younger scientists, many of whom can't remember a time without smart phones, Google, and social media.
