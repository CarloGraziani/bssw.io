Anyone who has spent any time in a large organization can attest to the fact that it can be difficult to find out what other teams are working on. For projects involving software development, this can often be a missed opportunity, particularly when a project is in it's start up phase and could benefit from existing expertise, code, or algorithms developed by other teams. At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we have been attempting to overcome some of these communication barriers through Software Expos - an initiative started in 2014 by Jay Jay Billings, team leader of the Scientific Software Development team - that provide a venue where software engineers, developers, and domain scientists can share experiences and discuss their projects.

The most recent Software Expo was held in May 2018 over three days. This was a departure from previous Expos, which were a single day
of poster presentations. Expanding the meeting to three days allowed for a much greater variety of topics and activities 
in order to make attending the meeting as worthwhile as possible.

The first day was comprised of dual tutorial tracks, covering many mature software projects developed by ORNL researchers, as well as some commonly used packages. Topics included quantum computing, I/O frameworks, workflow platforms, computational workbenches, math libraries, and programming models. In addition, the afternoon session was also made available for hackathons, so that researchers could discuss ideas and problems in a hands-on, interactive, format.

The second day was reserved for a morning poster session that enabled all participants to showcase their projects. Nearly 40 posters were
submitted for this session. This was followed by a panel discussion on promoting software related activities and communication within the laboratory. The afternoon session was taken up with a keynote presentation by Will Deacon on the latest advances in ARM technology. The final activity of the day was a best poster award presentation.

Day three began with a four hour tutorial on DevOps in the Cloud - Iterate and Innovate Faster with Amazon Web Services (AWS). As cloud based services are becoming more popular at ORNL, this was a great opportunity to get first hand experience on leveraging AWS to increase developer productivity. The remainder of the day was taken up with Birds of a Feather sessions, where project teams had the opportunity to discuss their projects in greater detail.

Overall, the ORNL Software Expo 2018 was a well attended and worthwhile event. It managed to bring together a diverse group of scientific software developers, software engineers, and domain scientists in a forum that encouraged discussion and collaboration. A wide variety of tutorials also allowed less experienced participants to enhance their skills across a broad range of topics. This type of event provides
an excellent means of enhancing communication across the laboratory, and I'm looking forward to participating again next year!
