Helping code teams improve their software development, productivity, and sustainability is no small challenge. 
  
<em> In the IDEAS Productivity Project, we have found that one of the keys to aiding the ECP software development teams involves extensive outreach to the broader community of computational scientists and engineers (CSE) in high-performance computing (HPC). </em>

The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) needs to deliver a software environment and applications ready to run on exascale computers, which are scheduled to be deployed starting in 2021. This entails a major, large-scale software development effort. Recognizing the challenges development teams will face, the ECP is supporting the IDEAS Productivity project team to help developers improve their development practices.

Our goal is to work with as many of the code teams as want our help (some already have excellent software development practices or are comfortable improving on their own). We have developed a Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Process (PSIP) that breaks the process down into smaller steps, which are easier to implement and help the realize improvements sooner through a series of iterations. The real work has to be done by the project team, but we help all along the way. Sometimes that involves helping them analyze their situation and understanding the origins of their software development challenges. Sometimes it is helping them learn about best practices. And sometimes it is helping them implement them.

But we’re not a large project, and there are many code teams across ECP. So how do we do it? We do a lot of outreach! That may sound like a contradiction, but it really isn’t. Based on our own collective experience in the HPC/CSE area, as well as initial interviews with many code teams, we know many topics that are likely to come up in the PSIP process. Every new code team interview, or a conversation with a colleague outside of ECP, is likely to turn up more topics or reinforce ones already on our list. 

We use this information to guide the development of tutorial materials, the selection of webinar topics, and other outreach activities. If we’re going to help one code team with a topic, others are likely to be interested too. We look for existing tutorials to point our colleagues to, but for software development topics, it can be hard to find. So we also develop tutorial materials that we can present in a variety of venues. Sometimes, we even have the opportunity to record a tutorial and make it available on the web. The code teams we’re supporting can benefit from these tutorials, but so can the broader community. We’ve given tutorials at large-scale venues such as the Supercomputing and ISC conference series, SIAM Computational Science and Engineering, and others.

Since 2016, we’ve also been producing a webinar series called Best Practices for HPC Software Developers (HPC-BP). These are shorter than tutorials – typically just an hour. So we try to think of them as introductions – giving people a taste of a topic, and letting them decide if they want to dig deeper on their own – and we cast a wide net of topics and speakers (not just from the IDEAS project). Since these are “virtual” events, and relatively short, it is easier for people to participate. We’ve had over 1200 people register for the 19 webinars we’ve had so far. Perhaps 25% of registrants are associated with ECP projects, so once again, we’re reaching a much broader audience.

The material that goes into these tutorials and webinars doesn’t come out of thin air. It comes from our experience, and that of others. We learn about it by reading papers and books, and also by hearing presentations and talking to people about it, one-on-one. So we another form of outreach that we consider invaluable is to help promote conversations about software development – something which used to be relatively rare, but, fortunately, we now seeing more emphasis on, and more opportunities. For our part, we organize minisymposia, topical poster sessions, and birds-of-a-feather sessions.

What about the self-starters, who don’t want to wait for a scheduled event like a tutorial or a webinar? Or those who want to dig deeper on a particular topic? The internet offers a vast array of opinions and resources about software development and software engineering practices. But for someone in the HPC/CSE community, it can be daunting – there’s so much material out there, and it is hard to know what might have been tried in a CSE context, and how well it worked, or what kind of tailoring might have been done to make it useful. Experience shows that software development in the HPC/CSE context is different in some ways than more general software development. And most of us have seen “best practices” recommended by the broader community which make little sense in the HPC/CSE world. So we launched this site – Better Scientific Software – to serve as a portal where members of the HPC/CSE community can find information that other community members have found useful. From the community, for the community. Which includes our colleagues on the ECP code teams.

So you might describe our approach to helping the ECP code teams improve their software development practices as “Think Locally, Act Globally”. For us, outreach to the broader HPC/CSE community is part of promoting the world-wide conversation that help all of us improve.
