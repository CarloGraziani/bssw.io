Anyone who has spent time in a large organization can attest to the fact that finding out what other teams are working on can be difficult.
For projects involving software development, this situation can often mean a missed opportunity, particularly when a project is in its startup phase and could benefit from existing expertise, code, or algorithms developed by other teams.
This problem can be exacerbated by the security-conscious environments at the national laboratories.
Two labs, Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore, have started events to help software developers break out of the isolation and meet others working on similar projects.

## ORNL Software Expo

At Oak Ridge National Laboratory, we have been attempting to overcome some of these communication barriers through Software Expos. The initiative -- started in 2014 by Jay Jay Billings, team leader of the Scientific Software Development team -- provides a venue where software engineers, developers, and domain scientists can share experiences and discuss their projects.

The most recent Software Expo was held May 15-17, 2018.
This three-day event was a departure from previous expos, which were a single day of poster presentations.
Expanding the meeting to three days allowed for a much greater variety of topics and activities in order to make attending the meeting as worthwhile as possible.

The first day comprised dual tutorials covering many mature software projects developed by ORNL researchers, as well as some commonly used packages.
Topics included quantum computing, I/O frameworks, workflow platforms, computational workbenches, math libraries, and programming models.
In addition, the afternoon included a hackathon session, where researchers could discuss ideas and problems in a hands-on, interactive format.

The second day was reserved for a morning poster session that enabled all participants to showcase their projects.
Nearly 40 posters were submitted for the session.
This was followed by a panel discussion on promoting software-related activities and communication within the laboratory.
The afternoon session was taken up with a keynote presentation by Will Deacon on the latest advances in ARM technology.
The final activity of the day was a presentation of the best poster award.

Day three began with a four-hour tutorial on DevOps in the Cloud -- Iterate and Innovate Faster with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
As cloud-based services are becoming more popular at ORNL, this was a great opportunity to get first-hand experience in leveraging AWS to increase developer productivity.
The remainder of the day was taken up with Birds of a Feather sessions, where project teams had the opportunity to discuss their projects in greater detail.

Overall, the ORNL Software Expo 2018 was a well-attended and worthwhile event.
It brought together a diverse group of scientific software developers, software engineers, and domain scientists in a forum that encouraged discussion and collaboration.
The wide variety of tutorials also allowed less-experienced participants to enhance their skills across a broad range of topics.
This type of event provides an excellent means of enhancing communication across the laboratory, and we're looking forward to  next year's expo.

## LLNL Developer Day

At Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Kyle Dickerson spearheaded the Developer Day initiative to bring software developers together.
Begun in 2017, Developer Day was designed to reduce the duplication of effort between teams across the Laboratory working on similar projects. Whether writing algorithms for security applications or developing a website, programmers can use the event to discover new methods and share solutions that will improve their day-to-day work.

The second annual Developer Day event was held in August 2018. Dickerson began with a keynote talk titled "Pragmatic Software Development."
Using the Japanese concept of Kaizen, or continuous improvement, he outlined why software development requires craftsmanship.
"We went to school and learned computer science, but we still need to learn and apply the art of computer science," said Dickerson, with an emphasis on "art."
Even if used for the same purpose, he said, two pieces of software can vary widely in design, usability, and long-term maintainability.
"There's no such a thing as perfect software," he said, but everyone is responsible for writing responsible code that can be improved upon in the future.

The day featured a series of "Lightning Talks" -- quick successions of three-minute project overviews.
These talks formed the backbone of Developer Day by giving exposure to 24 different projects from around the lab.
"The success of Developer Day is measured by the connections that people in our audience make to each other," said Elsa Gonsiorowski, one of the organizers of this year's event.

Expanding on the first year's Developer Day, the organizers included two panel sessions.
During the "Computing in the Future" panel, Robin Goldstone, Cyrus Harrison, and Jonathan DuBois each outlined how the future of computing might look at Lawrence Livermore, a place already responsible for so much of the nation's progress in that field.
The second panel, "Mentoring and Mentor Programs," provided a close look at the resources, strategies, and opportunities available to young staff and interns in Computation at the Laboratory.

The afternoon featured four "Deep Dive" sessions, where speakers had 45 minutes to speak in depth on a particular topic of interest.
One such Deep Dive came from Justin Barno.
He explained the computer science concept of a "container," a way of separating pieces of software into discrete, self-sufficient items for ease of transport and modularization.

Plans are already under way for a third annual Developer Day.
As the LLNL developer community becomes stronger, Developer Day can grow into larger event.
