# Better Scientific Software: Get Oriented

The Better Scientific Software site is a central hub for sharing information on practices, techniques, experiences, and tools to improve CSE software productivity, quality, and sustainability.  We are raising awareness of the importance of good software practices to scientific productivity and to the quality and reliability of computationally-based scientific results.  Another goal is to raise awareness of the increasing challenges facing CSE software developers as high-end computing heads to extreme scales.   

### Whatâ€™s Here?
The site provides instructional materials, WhatIs and HowTo documents (concise characterizations and best practices), and a community-driven collection of resources on software development and software engineering, all in an accessible CSE context in order to improve software productivity, quality and sustainability in support of scientific advances.  
                 
### Who Contributes and Why?
We welcome contributions from anyone who would like to share information on software issues for CSE.  Goals are to help CSE researchers work more effectively both within their own projects and also to increase collaboration, leverage, recognition, and impact---all with the long-term goal of advancing scientific discoveries.  Please see [What To Contribute](WhatToContribute.md) and [How To Contribute](HowToContribute.md).

### What Is CSE?
Computational science and engineering (CSE) is a multidisciplinary field of research and education lying at the intersection of applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, and core disciplines of science and engineering.  CSE is devoted to the development and use of computational methods for scientific discovery in all branches of the sciences, for the advancement of innovation in engineering and technology, and for the support of decision-making across a spectrum of societally important application areas. CSE is widely recognized as an essential driver of scientific and technological progress in conjunction with theory and experiment.      

### Why Is CSE Software So Important?
Software is the key crosscutting technology that connects advances in applied mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering for advanced discovery and analysis in CSE. While software is becoming more complex due to multiphysics and multiscale modeling, the coupling of data analytics, and disruptive changes in computer hardware, software itself has not traditionally received focused attention in the CSE community.  

The Better Scientific Software community is working to enable software to fulfill its critical role as an essential cornerstone of long-term CSE collaboration and discovery.
     
### What are Unique Aspects of CSE Software?
In comparison to larger software communities for whom much of the software improvement literature has been written, the CSE community has a number of distinct characteristics.  In particular: 
- Most CSE software developers have an advanced degree and many years of experience in their domain, but very little if any formal training in software engineering.
- Many CSE software products are used by the developers and a small group of colleagues.
- Due to the nature of scientific research, CSE software requirements often change as understanding evolves and next steps of research are determined.

### New To High-Performance Computing (HPC)?  Learn about additional concerns for CSE software in HPC. 
High-Performance Computing is the application of parallel computers to computational problems that are either too large for standard computers or would take too long.  HPC and CSE are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship: HPC technology enables breakthroughs in CSE research, and leading-edge CSE applications are the main drivers for the evolution of supercomputer systems.  

CSE software in HPC must address a broad range of complexities, including memory management for hierarchical and heterogeneous systems, refactoring to achieve portable performance in the face of evolving architectures, and challenges of multiscale and multiphysics modeling, simulation, and analysis.  The Better Scientific Software community is working to overcome challenges in CSE software complexity in both traditional HPC environments (clusters, networks of workstations, petascale machines) as well as <emerging extreme-scale architectures--hyperlink to Exascale Computing Community page>.
