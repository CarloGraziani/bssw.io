# Questions About Contributing

This file will contain a form which allows readers to ask us questions about contributing.

The drop down boxes should be

3. I have a suggestion
4. Others

We want and _need_ contributions from the community. If you have experience or expertise that can help other scientific software teams, we encourage you to contribute an original article or point users to existing resources you find useful.

We aim to help CSE researchers work more effectively and to increase collaboration, leverage, recognition, and impact â€” all with the long-term goal of advancing scientific discoveries.  Please see [README.md](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/betterscientificsoftware.github.io/blob/master/README.md)
