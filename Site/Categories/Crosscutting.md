# Crosscutting Resources

**Description:**  Resources that apply to several different aspects of producing better scientific software.

**Overview:** There are many resources that are broader in scope than any one of the other categories used to organize the information on this site.  Crosscutting resources include other projects and organizations, as well as funding agencies and programs that support improving software development and sustainability, Q&A forums and online learning sites, as well as efforts to help recognize and value contributions to software, such as software citation.

**Topics:**

- **Funding sources and programs:**
Sources of financial support for efforts to improve scientific software development practices, productivity, sustainability, and community-building. Note that this is distinct from traditional computational science and engineering R&D.
