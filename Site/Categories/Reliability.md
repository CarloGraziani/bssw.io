# Better Reliability

**Basic Description:**  Methods for testing and verification to ensure that software is robust and produces reliable results.

**Brief Overview:** Good software reliability helps to ensure the integrity of CSE research for predictive simulations and decision support.  Moreover, because software encapsulates complex functionality for use by others, the reliability of CSE software is essential for collaborations that involve the combined use of software developed by independent groups.  

**Quote:** “Correctness is clearly the prime quality. If a system does not do what it is supposed to do, then everything else about it matters little.” — Bertrand Meyer

**Topics:**

- **Debugging:** The process of finding and fixing defects in software.

  Debugging involves the creative application of a variety of strategies and/or tools to diagnose the cause of a defective software behavior, to develop and implement a correction and finally to confirm, typically through [_regression testing_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing), the correction fixes the defect without introducing more defects.

- **Continuous integration testing:** Testing occurs at the same frequency and granularity as _isolated_ code changes.

  Taken to its extreme, you can think of continuous integration (CI) testing like auto-correct in a word processor where code tests are performed with each key-stroke entered by a programmer. Of course, this isn't truly practical. However CI testing is aimed in the direction of high frequency and fine grained testing of each isolated code change committed by developers.
