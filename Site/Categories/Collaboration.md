# Better Collaboration

**Basic Description:**  Ways to facilitate and distribute work across teams, promote partnerships via software, and contribute to stronger communities.

**Brief Overview:** Software is the key crosscutting technology that sustains long-term CSE collaboration, encapsulating advances in applied mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering for use by others.  We provide information for CSE projects of all sizes, ranging from small teams (for example, a professor and collaborating students) to broad partnerships that span different scientific, institutional, and geographic areas.  

**Topics:**

- **Version control:** Management of changes to files.  Also known as revision control, source control, or source management.

- **Issue tracking:** is the process of managing a collection of issues (bugs, feature requests, missing documentation, etc.) that are currently being handled, or should be handled, by a software development team.

  An issue *tracker* is a software system that is used by the software developers to keep track of the issues (who is responsible for each issue, when the issue was reported, etc). Most modern issue trackers used in the open source community are web-based and provide rich functionality for adding new issues, assigning issues to developers, recording notes on the issue, linking repository commits associated with the issue, etc. Issue trackers can also be used to plan new development activities.

- **Licensing:** A legal instrument governing the use or redistribution of software.

  Copyright and patents are two of the primary legal frameworks used around the world to govern the intellectual property rights associated with software.  Patents are related to the novel ideas embodied in the software, while copyright is associated with the expression of the code itself.  License agreements provide a means for the owners of the intellectual property rights to selectively grant rights to others, such as the use or redistribution of the software.
