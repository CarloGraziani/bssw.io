# Better Planning

**Description:**  Strategies for planning in order to improve software productivity, quality, and sustainability.  

**Overview:** While the CSE community is concerned with software quality and sustainability, the process of software planning is often ad hoc and incomplete, largely due to the unique characteristics of scientific software, which are not well aligned with mainstream software planning guidelines.  We provide resources to help teams with planning, while acknowledging that software requirements often change during scientific discovery.  

**Topics:**

- **Requirements:**
Statements about *what* functions a software product shall perform including any constraints under which it shall operate but avoiding any entanglements in *how* it shall be implemented.

- **Legacy code:**
Source code in which investments, tangible and in-tangible, are so great that wholesale re-write to *optimally* utilize newer computing technology is deemed too costly and/or too risky.

- **Refactoring:**
The process of improving *internal* attributes of a software product (e.g. readability, maintainability) without modifying any of its existing external functionality.
