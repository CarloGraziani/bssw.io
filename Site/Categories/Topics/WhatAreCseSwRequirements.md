# What are CSE Software Requirements?

In software development, a *requirement* is a singular, documented statement identifying a capability, characteristic, or
quality a software product shall possess to satisfy *one* of the needs of it's stakeholders (e.g. developers, users, sponsors, etc.).

Software requirements *specification* is the process of eliciting and documenting whole sets of requirements aimed at defining
the complete capabilities of a software component, product or system. The resulting document is also often refered to as the
*Requirements Specification* or *Requirements Spec.* or, imprecisely, just *Spec*.

In CSE, software requirements typically arise out of the needs of users to perform some computational operation. For example,
given a software package to model the [Heat Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation), users may *require* that
the package support anisotropic thermally conductive media or that it support strong scaling of the homogenous

For software developers, requirements are necessary to understand the capabilities their software must meet. For software users,
requirements are necessary 


why need them?
- establish terms of contract, scope of desgin, 

requirements vs. requirements specification

types of requirements; functional, performance, interface, implementation, reliability, availability, 

examples

challenges in defining
- don't know what you don't know
- verbiage steeped in how business is done today
- often not fully specified (time vs. space)
- what vs. how statements
- change with time

In theory, if all requirements are fully specified, a software product meeting those requirements fits terms of contract

waterfall vs. agile paradigms and how requirements fit int
