# What is Issue Tracking? Note, the first part is identical to the material in the collaboration.md file; how do we organize the material so it can be presented in multiple places but there is only one copy in the repository? Plus if the material on this page is provided as a popup in the collaboration.md page then the first part should NOT be displayed in the popup.

Issue tracking is the process of managing a collection of issues (bugs, feature requests, missing documentation, etc.) that are currently being handled, or should be handled, by a software development team.

An issue tracker is a software system that is used by the software developers to keep track of the issues (who is responsible for each issue, when the issue was reported, etc). Most modern issue trackers are web-based and provide rich functionality for adding new issues, assigning issues to developers, recording notes on the issue, linking repository commits associated with the issue, etc. Issue trackers can also be used to plan new development activities.



An "issue" represents a unit of work needed to accomplish an improvement in a system. A bug tracker is an example of an issue tracker devoted only to managing a collection of bug reports.  2-sentence description goes here.
