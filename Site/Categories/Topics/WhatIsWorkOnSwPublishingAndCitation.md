### What Is Work on Software Publishing and Citation?

Peer-reviewed papers are the "gold standard" for credit and recognition of research contributions in an academic setting.  Employers and research sponsors typically value technical papers, as well as citation rates within the commuity as measures of productivity and impact, thus incentivizing researchers to focus on them.  An important part of efforts to produce better scientific software is to push such organizations to recognize software contributions so that researchers who are making contributions in this way can be appropriately recognized and rewarded.  Fundamental to this is the ability to treat software as a publishable artifact and have it cited appropriately in the technical literature.  At the same time, making more directly software visible in searches of scientific literature will help potential users discover software they may benefit from using. As a community, we are still experimenting with various methods of citing software while trying to keep up with the rapidly accelerating scale, pace, and visibility of scientific software development. This topic proides pointers to venues that support publishing of software artifacts, and organizations developing and promoting principles for the appropriate citation of software.
