### What Are Discussion Forums and Q&A Sites for Better Scientific Software?

An increasing number of online discussion forums or question and answer (Q&A) sites on the internet support communities with common interests, such as computational science and engineering (CSE).  Users of the site may ask questions pertaining to the topic of the site, which are answered by other members of the community.  Typically multiple users can offer answers, and the community can endorse certain answers as being better or more useful than others. Such sites typically define their scope, and questions which are considered out of scope are discouraged.  This topic covers resources which are open to questions about software development, productivity, and sustainability, as opposed to, for example, questions about algorithms or the use of particular numerical libraries, or other questions about CSE software.
