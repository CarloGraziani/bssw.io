# What is CSE Software Refactoring?

Software refactoring is the process of restructuring source code to achieve improvements in various non-functional attributes
of the software such as maintainability, readability, complexity and extensibility to name a few. In particular,
refactoring does not change any of the software product's external functionality. Refactoring is a way of improving developer
productivity

Ideally, refactoring should not proceed *without* first having a collection of *unit tests* with sufficient
[*coverage*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage) of the code to be refactored.
