### What Are Development Tools?

Development tools are tools that support different aspects of software design and implementation, such as editors, 
integrated development environments, performance measurement and analysis tools, memory checkers, and debuggers.
Some tools, e.g., debuggers, are designed for a single development activity type. 
Other tools support a variety of different tasks, for example, the Eclipse IDE provides support for 
editing, compilation, testing, debugging, and performance analysis.
