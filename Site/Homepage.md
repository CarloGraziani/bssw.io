Prior version:
Scientific software has emerged as an essential discipline in its own right.   Because computational models, computer architectures, and scientific software projects have become extremely complex, the Computational Science & Engineering (CSE) community now has a unique opportunity—and an implicit mandate—to address pressing challenges in scientific software productivity, quality, and sustainability.
