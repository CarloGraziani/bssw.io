# Intro to HPC

High-Performance Computing (HPC) is the application of parallel computers to computational problems that are either too large for standard computers or would take too long.


HPC and CSE are intertwined in a symbiotic relationship: HPC technology enables breakthroughs in CSE research, and leading-edge CSE applications are the main drivers for the evolution of supercomputer systems.  CSE software in HPC must address a broad range of complexities, including memory management for hierarchical and heterogeneous systems, refactoring to achieve portable performance in the face of evolving architectures, and challenges of multiscale and multiphysics modeling, simulation, and analysis.  The Better Scientific Software community is working to overcome challenges in CSE software complexity in both traditional HPC environments (clusters, networks of workstations, petascale machines) as well as [emerging extreme-scale architectures](Communities.ExascaleComputing.md).  More details on HPC software productivity challenges are provided in the following reports:

HPC software productivity challenges are discussed in the following community report: _**Software Productivity for Extreme-scale Science**_, H. Johansen, L.C. McInnes, et al., 2014, Report on DOE Workshop, http://www.orau.gov/swproductivity2014/SoftwareProductivityWorkshopReport2014.pdf.
