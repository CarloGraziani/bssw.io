# Better Collaboration

**Basic Description:**  Ways to facilitate and distribute work across teams, promote partnerships via software, and contribute to stronger communities.
                    
**Brief Overview:** Software is the key crosscutting technology that sustains long-term CSE collaboration, encapsulating advances in applied mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering for use by others.  We provide information for CSE projects of all sizes, ranging from small teams (for example, a professor and collaborating students) to broad partnerships that span different scientific, institutional, and geographic areas.
