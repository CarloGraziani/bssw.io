# Communities

Contributors to the Better Scientific Software site are working together to advance the methods, practices, and processes of CSE software.  Goals are to fully realize the role of CSE software as a cornerstone of long-term collaboration and scientific discoveryâ€”and in turn tp help build stronger communities that increase leverage, recognition, and impact.  

The Better Scientific Software umbrella encompasses a rich variety of communities that address complementary facets of CSE software, including applications domains (such as modeling of terrestrial ecosystems, climate, fusion, chemistry, materials science, high-energy physics, etc.), scientific libraries, exascale computing, and a variety of other areas.

In order to promote a shared understanding of software issues among the members of these various communities, as well as a variety of starting points for using the BSSW site, we provide community-specific landing pages, which can be tailored to the unique perspectives and priorities of each community.  

### Better Scientific Software Communities:
- [Exascale Computing Community](Communities.ExascaleComputing.md)
- [Terrestrial Ecosystem Community](Communities.TerrestrialEcosystem.md)
- [Scientific Libraries Community](Communities.SoftwareLibraries.md)
- [Software Engineering Community](Communities.SoftwareEngineering.md)
- and many more ...

We want your input and perspectives.  Please contact us if you would like to start a community-specific landing page.
