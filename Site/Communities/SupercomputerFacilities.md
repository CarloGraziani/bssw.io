# The Community of Supercomputer Facilities and their Users

Many computational scientists and engineers access high-performance computing resources through one or more centralized supercomputing facilities, which serve many users.

Although the details of the systems, tools, and support resources available can vary greatly from one facility to another, there are many high-level aspects that are common across them.  Due to inherent lifetimes and technoligical change, supercomputer systems must be changed periodically (5 years is typical for supercomputers).  Also, with limited resources available for support and training, facilities must typically focus first and foremost on the systems, tools, and environments that they're fielding at any given moment.  This can pose a challenge for users, who are in many cases using multiple supercomputer facilities simultaneously.  The goal of BSSw in supporting supercomputer facilities and users is to provide a place for information that spans facilities and specific computer architectures, complementing local facility resources, and helps users deal wtih multiple environments in a productive and sustainable way.

There are a vast number of supercomputing facilities around the world, and it is impossible to list them all, but some of used by BSSw contributors include:

## Software challenges for supercomputer facilities and their users

Performance portablity is often a significant concern for users of multiple facilities. Many facilities offer support to improve the performance of an application of the platform(s) they field, but it is hard for them to speak definitively about an application they are not deeply familiar with on platforms they don't have deep familiarity with either.  Thus, the onus for performance portability is on the users.  In the course of working with facility staff on performance, debugging, or other issues, it is best for everyone when such issues can be quickly isolted and addressed.  This can be greatly facilitated by emphasizing software quality, documentation, and testing during the development process.
