# Better Collaboration

**Overview:** Improving ways to facilitate work across teams and to promote partnerships and community contributions via software. We consider projects of all sizes, from small teams through multi-institutional aggregate teams.  

**Child Topics:**

- **Projects and organizations**
Projects and organizations having a particular emphasis on scientific software development, productivity, and sustainability.

- **Strategies for more effective teams**
Approaches for building teams and improving cohesion---working with small, large, and distributed teams---as well as practices for fostering a culture of inclusion and creating safe spaces, even if virtual, in which teams operate.

- **Funding sources and programs**
Sources of financial support for efforts to improve scientific software development practices, productivity, sustainability, and community building. These efforts are distinct from traditional computational science and engineering R&D.

- **Software publishing and citation**
Why and how to publish and cite software as a distinct, independent artifact (i.e., different from scientific papers), as well as information on publication venues for software development topics, as distinct from scientific results and methods.

- **Licensing**
The legal side of controlling software distribution and use, as well as implications of practices and impact on collaboration and growth of software projects.

- **Discussion and question sites**
Discussion forums and sites where questions about scientific software development, productivity, and sustainability are welcome.

<!--
- **Conferences and Workshops NEW**
Recurring series of conferences and workshops that highlight advances in scientific software productivity and sustainability.
