# Better Collaboration

**Overview:** Software is the key crosscutting technology that sustains long-term CSE collaboration, encapsulating advances in applied mathematics, computer science, and domain-specific science and engineering for use by others.  We provide information for CSE projects of all sizes, ranging from small teams (for example, a professor and collaborating students) to broad partnerships that span different scientific, institutional, and geographic areas.  

**Child Topics:**

- **Projects and organizations:**
Projects and organizations having a particular emphasis on scientific software development, productivity, and sustainability.

- **Strategies for more effective teams:**
Ways to foster teamwork, leveraging people's diverse skills in pursuit of a common goal. 

- **Funding sources and programs:**
Sources of financial support for efforts to improve scientific software development practices, productivity, sustainability, and community-building. Note that these efforts are distinct from traditional computational science and engineering R&D.

- **Software publishing and citation:**
Publishing and citing of software as a distinct artifact (i.e., different from scientific papers); and publication venues focusing on software development topics, as distinct from the scientific results and methods.

- **Licensing:**
The legal side of controlling software distribution and use.  

- **Discussion and question sites:**
Discussion forums and sites where questions about scientific software development, productivity, and sustainability are welcome.
