# Better Planning

**Overview:** While the CSE community is concerned with software quality and sustainability, the process of software planning is often ad hoc and incomplete, largely due to the unique characteristics of scientific software, which are not well aligned with mainstream software planning guidelines.  We provide resources to help teams with planning, while acknowledging that software requirements often change during scientific discovery.  

**Topics:**

- **Design:**
Major considerations in designing software to meet its scientific objectives and sustainability goals.

- **Requirements:**
Statements about *what* functions a software product shall perform including any constraints under which it shall operate but avoiding any entanglements in *how* it shall be implemented.

- **Software interoperability:**
The ability of two or more software elements to be used together in an application, without special effort on the part of the user.
