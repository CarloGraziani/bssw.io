# Better Planning

**Overview:** 
Improving strategies for planning in order to increase software productivity, quality, and sustainability, while underscoring the unique characteristics of scientific software, including that requirements often change during discovery.

**Child Topics:**

- **Design:**
Major considerations in designing software to meet its scientific objectives and sustainability goals. Because requirements for scientific software often change during scientific discovery, design tends to evolve over time.

- **Requirements:**
Statements about what functions a software product shall perform including any constraints under which it shall operate but avoiding as much as possible entanglements in how it shall be implemented.

- **Software interoperability:**
The ability of two or more software elements to be used together in an application, without special effort on the part of the user.  Levels of interoperability range from side-by-side usage through various types of interactions between packages.
