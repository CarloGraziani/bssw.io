# Better Reliability

**Overview:** Good software reliability helps ensure the integrity of CSE research for predictive simulations and decision support.  Moreover, because software encapsulates complex functionality for use by others, the reliability of CSE software is essential for collaborations that involve the combined use of software developed by independent groups.  

**Child Topics:**

- **Testing:**
The process of ensuring that a software product is meeting its requirements.

- **Continuous Integration Testing:**
A form of testing *maximally* integrated with code commits.

- **Reproducibility:**
Any effort whose goal is to increase trustworthiness and reuse of computational capabilities and results and to ensure correctness.

- **Debugging:**
The process of finding and fixing defects in software.
