# Better Reliability

**Overview:** 
Improving methods of testing and verification to ensure that software is robust and produces reliable results, thereby helping to ensure the integrity of research and enable collaboration across teams.

**Child Topics:**

- **Testing:**
The process of ensuring that a software product is meeting its requirements at each stage of development, delivery, and deployment. Testing helps to avoid defects and verify correctness.

- **Continuous Integration Testing:**
Testing that is maximally integrated with code commits to promote efficient co-development and well-defined delivery criteria. 

- **Reproducibility:**
Any effort whose goal is to increase trustworthiness and reuse of computational capabilities and results and to ensure correctness. 

- **Debugging:**
The process of finding and fixing software when new requirements arise or defects are detected.
