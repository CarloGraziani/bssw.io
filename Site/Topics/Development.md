# Better Development

**Overview:** 
Improving scientific software development—a process of writing, maintaining, and extending code—in order to increase software productivity, quality, and sustainability, as key aspects of advancing overall scientific productivity.

- **Refactoring:**
The process of improving internal attributes of a software product (e.g. readability, maintainability) without modifying any of its existing external functionality.

- **Software Engineering:**
Procedures and considerations for getting a well engineered, reliable and maintained software.

- **Documentation:**
Creating, maintaining, and hosting quality documentation (written text or illustration) about the use, operation, or design of software. 

- **Version Control:**
Approaches for managing changes to files (source code, documentation, data) as well as maintaining their history and attribution, especially across multiple contributors and branches of development (also known as version control).

- **Configuration and Builds:**
Ensuring that users can easily configure, compile, link, test, and interoperate software packages for the various computing environments in which they are needed.

- **Software Distribution:**
Approaches for versioning, packaging, releasing, and deploying software, documentation, or data for users to then obtain, install, and use.

- **Programming Languages and Tools:**
Programming languages as well as tools that support various aspects of software development, such as editors, integrated development environments, performance measurement and analysis tools, and memory checkers.

- **Issue Tracking:**
The process of capturing, reporting, tracking, and managing information about issues related to software. Issues include bugs, feature requests, missing documentation, and other problems and/or requirements.
