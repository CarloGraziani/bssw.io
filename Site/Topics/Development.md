- **Refactoring:**
The process of improving internal attributes of a software product (e.g. readability, maintainability) without modifying any of its existing external functionality.
<!---Topic order: 7--->

- **Software Engineering:**
Procedures and considerations for getting a well engineered, reliable and maintained software.
<!---Topic order: 8--->

- **Documentation:**
Creating, maintaining, and hosting quality documentation (written text or illustration) about the use, operation, or design of software.
<!---Topic order: 1--->

- **Version Control:**
Approaches for managing changes to files (source code, documentation, data) as well as maintaining their history and attribution, especially across multiple contributors and branches of development (also known as version control).
<!---Topic order: 3--->

- **Configuration and Builds:**
Ensuring that users can easily configure, compile, link, test, and interoperate software packages for the various computing environments in which they are needed.
<!---Topic order: 2--->

- **Software Distribution:**
Approaches for versioning, packaging, releasing, and deploying software, documentation, or data for users to then obtain, install, and use.
<!---Topic order: 4--->

- **Programming Languages and Tools:**
Programming languages as well as tools that support various aspects of software development, such as editors, integrated development environments, performance measurement and analysis tools, and memory checkers.
<!---Topic order: 6--->

- **Issue Tracking:**
The process of capturing, reporting, tracking, and managing information about issues related to software. Issues include bugs, feature requests, missing documentation, and other problems and/or requirements.
