# Better Development

**Overview:** Software development is a process of writing, maintaining, and extending source code to create software products. In a broad sense, software development includes all that is involved between the conception of the software through to the final manifestation of the software. 

**Child Topics:**

- **Refactoring:**
The process of improving *internal* attributes of a software product (e.g. readability, maintainability) without modifying any of its existing external functionality.

- **Software Engineering:**
Procedures and considerations for getting a well engineered, reliable and maintained software.

- **Documentation:**
Written text or illustration that accompanies computer software to explain how it operates or how to use it.  

- **Version Control:**
Management of changes to files.  Also known as revision control, source control, or source management.

- **Configuration and Builds:**
Installing scientific software from source requires a system for setting up (configuring) software to compile and link (build) the code according to the user's specific platform and needs.

- **Software Distribution:**
Making software available to users and related activities. This could involve providing users with an installer, deploying the software on systems where the users can access it, or a combination of both.

- **Programming Languages and Tools:**
Programming languages as well as tools that support various aspects of software development, such as editors, integrated development environments, performance measurement and analysis tools, and memory checkers.

- **Issue Tracking:**
The process of managing a collection of issues (bugs, feature requests, missing documentation, etc.) that are currently being handled, or should be handled, by a software development team.
