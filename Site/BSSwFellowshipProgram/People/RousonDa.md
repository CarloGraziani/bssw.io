**Short Bio:** Bridging agile software development to underrepresented groups

**Long Bio:** 
### Expand the demographics of scientific software development to include underrepresented groups.
Damian will develop and teach agile software development tutorials in settings that reach underrepresented groups.  The only prerequisites will be familiarity with a Linux shell and a text editor. A related, novel aspect of the tutorials will be the integration of a professional development activity using agile practices. 

Damian Rouson is a research engineer and member of the advisory board of Sustainable Horizons Institute. Damian has extensive experience in software design and development for multiphysics modeling, including classical, quantum, and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and multiphase flow.
