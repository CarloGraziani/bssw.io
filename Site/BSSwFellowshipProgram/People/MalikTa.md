**Short Bio:** Reducing technical debt in scientific software through reproducible containers

**Long Bio:** 
### Reduce technical debt in scientific software development using reproducible containers
Tanu is developing a workshop and tutorials on the use and practice of reproducible containers to reduce technical debt in scientific software.  Scientists often have to choose between pursuing a fast-paced research agenda and developing organized, sufficiently-documented, and reproducible systems. This workshop will seek for novel techniques, frameworks, and community input for reducing technical debt. She plans to use tutorials on reproducible containers as examples of reducing technical debt and solicit robust, practical and reproducible ideas.
