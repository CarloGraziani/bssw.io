**Short Bio:** Fellows guide efficient use of modern C++:  Just because a programming language allows various approaches doesnâ€™t mean that you should use them; programming is an art that should consider quality, sustainability, and performance. 

**Long Bio:** BSSw Fellow Andrew Lumsdaine has developed best practices for high-performance and high-quality software using modern C++ (up through C++17). His course materials include performance-orientated topics and migration from Fortran or previous versions of C++. Taking a careful slice of C++ focused on the needs of DOE application developers, the content includes performance-oriented topics such as pipelining, hierarchical memory, multithreading, and message passing. A unifying theme is the use of abstraction for expressiveness and for performance.

Andrew is a Fellow at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, affiliate professor of computer science at the University of Washington, and chief scientist at Northwest Institute for Advanced Computing.
