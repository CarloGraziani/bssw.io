**Short Bio:** Fellows give software developers long-overdue credit:  Paper citations are tracked to measure impact; similarly, software citations should be tracked to measure impact and recognize the significant time spent developing software and data. 

**Long Bio:** BSSw Fellow Daniel S. Katz developed principles for software citation to make scientific software more sustainable by providing credit to its developers, similar to research via paper citations. He led working groups to produce the principles, and he is currently working with publishers on implementation in institutionalized citation practices.
