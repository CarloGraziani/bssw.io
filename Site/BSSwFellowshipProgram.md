# BSSw Fellowship Program (Under construction)

The Better Scientific Software (BSSw) Fellowship Program gives recognition and opportunity to leaders and advocates of improved scientific software.  

## About Our Fellows Program

BSSw Fellows are selected annually based on an application process that includes the proposal of a funded activity that promotes better scientific software.  We select three fellows per year.  Each fellow is awarded up to $10,000 for an activity that promotes better scientific software.  Activities can include organizing a workshop, preparing a tutorial, or creating content to engage the scientific software community.

A BSSW Fellow receives funds for one year.  We encourage BSSw Fellows to continue to serve the scientific software community as alums by helping select future classes of fellows and providing leadership in their communities.

## Become a BSSw Fellow
Have something to share with the scientific software community?  Have a passion to learn and teach others about better software?  Apply for a BSSw Fellowship.  Help the community and receive funding and recognition for your efforts.  

# Eligibility

Applicants must be affiliated with a US-based institution that is able to receive funding from the US Department of Energy.  Typically this include US government labs, US universities and US-based corporations.  

Beyond this categorical requirement, we are looking for applications from people who are:
- Passionate about scientific software.
- Interested in contributing powerful ideas, tools, methodologies and more that improve the quality of scientific software.
- Able to use the fellowship to broadly impact the scientific software community.
- Willing to participate as an alum in subsequent years to guide selection of future fellows, and promote better scientific software in their community.
