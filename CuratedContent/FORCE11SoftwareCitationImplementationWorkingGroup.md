[FORCE11](https://www.force11.org/) is a community of scholars, librarians, archivists, publishers and research funders that has arisen organically to help facilitate the change toward improved knowledge creation and sharing. Individually and collectively, the members of FORCE11 aim to bring about a change in modern scholarly communications through the effective use of information technology.

The *FORCE11 [Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group)* builds on the previous [Software Citation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-working-group), which developed and publicized an initial set of [software citation principles](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.86). The activities of the *Software Citation Implementation Working Group* are to work with relevant stakeholders (publishers, librarians, archivists, funders, repository developers, other community forums with related working groups, etc.) to:

1. Endorse the principles.
2. Develop sets of guidelines for implementing the principles.
3. Help implement the principles.
4. Test specific implementations of the principles. During this process, the principles may also be updated based on feedback from the activities.

Below are two articles of interest which are direct products of the Force11 Working Group. The first article, much like its title, focuses on software citation principles.

Article title | [Software Citation Principles](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-86/)
Author(s) | Arfon M. Smith, Daniel S. Katz, Kyle E. Niemeyer
Focus | Software citation

Inspired by the activities of the FORCE11 working group focused on data citation, the "Software Citation Principles" article summarizes the recommendations of the FORCE11 Software Citation Working Group and its activities between June 2015 and April 2016. The goal of the working group was to produce a consolidated set of citation principles that may encourage broad adoption of a consistent policy for software citation across disciplines and venues. The authors of this article delve into how and why these specific principles support good software citation policies. 

A second group expounded on these same principles to create another in-depth exploration of software citation.

Focus | Software citation, scholarly communication, guidelines

Once again influenced by FORCE11's work with software ciation, this article provides broadly applicable guidance on software citation for the communities and institutions publishing academic journals and conference proceedings. Specific essentials and examples are provided to guide readers through the important parts of properly citing software.

Both articles stem directly from the FORCE11 working groups, and demonstrate their progress on this important topic.
