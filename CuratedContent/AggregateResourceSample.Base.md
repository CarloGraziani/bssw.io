# Aggregate Resource Sample: Base

This is a sample "base" file for an aggregate resource for the Better Scientific Software site.  Provide general introductory text for the topic in this file and then information on various subtopics in separate "section" files. Use the following metadata to describe the aggregate resource components:

This file ("base" for aggregate resource):  
- Aggregate: Base: [NameOfAggregateResourceBaseFile].md

Subtopic resource files:
- Aggregate: Base: [NameOfAggregateResourceBaseFile].md
- Aggregate: Section: [number of section in the aggregate, e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...]

The front-end for the BSSW site will combine the information into an aggregate resource as follows:
 - Aggregate: Base
 - Aggregate: Section 1
 - Aggregate: Section 2
 - Aggregate: Section 3
 - Etc.
