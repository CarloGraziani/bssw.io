Python is a very popular language in many domains. Traditionally, these are domains where speed of development and portability are more important than code performance. However, Python has now become popular in scientific computing and is becoming a de facto language for data science. Python is commonly used for rapid prototyping of numerical software and is becoming increasingly popular for implementing production software. Python is also used for application connectivity (glue) in many scientific workflows.
