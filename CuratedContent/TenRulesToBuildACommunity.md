A key point in particular
was for the project to seek to develop various forms of
[*legitimate peripheral participation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimate_peripheral_participation) for
newcomers. That is, simpler, lower risk tasks that nonetheless contribute to and further the
goals of the overall project. Another interesting tip was to tag issues with a
recogniziable label to indicate such issues are good for a newcomer *as well as* to ensure
veteran team members don't go fixing such issues :smile:

A key aspect to *sustainability* is to build a community; not just *users* of the software but also
advocates, mentors, developers, maintainers and even project leaders. The article is about a
15 minute read with many concrete suggestions and practices.
