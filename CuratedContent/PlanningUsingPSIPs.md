Scientific software teams are typically focused on the creation of a new set of features that will enable the next set of computational experiments.  Teams seldom have the time to stop development and focus solely on improving productivity or sustainability.  However, teams can incorporate improvements *on the way* to developing new science capabilities.

The Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) process recognizes that productivity and sustainability improvements for scientific software benefit from an incremental, iterative approach.  The *[PSIP GitHub repo](https://github.com/bssw-psip)* is a collection of documents that enable the adoption and use of PSIP for a software team.  

An ideal place to start learning about PSIP in the *PSIP* repo would be to start at the online *[PSIP user manual/practice guides](https://github.com/bssw-psip/practice-guides/blob/master/README.md)*. The *PSIP* repo contains everything starting from PSIP introduction, practice guides to PSIP examples. A critical part of a PSIP progress is a Progress Tracking Card (PTC), which contains the goal of the planning activity and a step-by-step list of activities or outcomes to achieve the goal. An invaluable collection of PTC cards can be found in the *PSIP* repo, for your perusal. In addition, you will also find detailed guidelines on how to systematically and easily create custom PTCs for your projects, even if you are practicing PSIP for the first time on your own.

The PSIP process has been successfully used to help scientific software teams acheive incremental, sustainable process improvement, while still achieving their science goals. The *PSIP* repo is an excellent starting point in your endeavour to learn about the PSIP software process improvement methodology.
