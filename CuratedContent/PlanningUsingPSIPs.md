# Planning for Better Software through PSIPs

Do you wish to learn how to upgrade your team's software practices? Do you have to improve software sustainability and productivity in an easy and efficient manner in your project? This article introduces the PSIP Software Improvement Process for scientific software.

Scientific software teams are typically focused on the creation of a new set of features that will enable the next set of computational experiments.  Teams seldom have the time to stop development and focus solely on improving productivity or sustainability.  However, teams can incorporate improvements *on the way* to developing new science capabilities.

The Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) process recognizes that productivity and sustainability improvements for scientific software benefit from an incremental, iterative approach.  The *[PSIP GitHub repo](https://github.com/bssw-psip)* is a collection of documents that enable the adoption and use of PSIP for a software team.  The *PSIP Github* repo contains everything starting from PSIP introuction, practice guides to PSIP examples. A critical part of a PSIP progress is a Progress Tracking Card (PTC), which contains the goal of the planning activity and a step-by-step list of activities or outcomes to achieve the goal. The *[PSIP GitHub repo]* provides an invaluable collection of PTC cards for your perusal. In addition, it provides detailed guidelines on how to systematically and easily create custom PTCs for your projects.

The PSIP process has been successfully used to help scientific software teams acheive incremental, sustainable process improvement, while still achieving their science goals. The *[PSIP GitHub repo]* is an excellent starting point in your endeavour to learn about the PSIP software process improvement methodology.
