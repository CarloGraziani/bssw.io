# Join The Inclusive Naming Initiative
<!--deck text start-->
As software developers, we exercise the power to name a lot. We name projects, products, servers, files, functions, variables and more. The names we use in our code and associated artifacts can invite people in or push them away.

There is probably no other human activity that involves the naming of new things as much as software development.
There is power in naming and with great power, comes great responsibility.
The names we use in our code and its associated artifacts (PR reviews, documenation, presentations, social media posts, etc.) are often shaped by our culture.

The [importance of naming](https://carlalexander.ca/importance-naming-programming/) in software development is a frequent subject of bloggers and industry pontificaters.
Many authors, however, overlook a key issue in the naming of things and that is using inclusive language.

Inclusive names aim to invite *everyone* in.
Harmful names appropriate underrepresented cultures, perpetuate stereotypes, and/or originate from oppressive or genocidal systems and will push many (potential collaborators, developers, users and/or sponsors) away.

An especially [prolific](https://github.com/search?q=master+slave&type=code), [egregious](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-confronts-use-labels-master-slave/) and [shameful](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/12/tech-industry-has-an-ugly-master-slave-problem/) example of harmful naming is the use of [*master-slave*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master/slave_(technology)) terminology.

The Inclusive Naming Initiative is a burgeoning, collaborative effort of technology organizations to address inclusive language across the industry.
The initiative began in the fall of 2020 and is slowly gaining membership and momentum.
All are welcome.
The goals include...

* Develop a set of principles for identifying and classifying harmful terms.
* Collect and distill existing know-how and expertise from member organizations and the broader tech community.
* Inventory harmful terms in current use.
* Document origins of harmful terms together with rationale and urgency for replacement.
* Propose multiple options for replacement terms for different contexts.
* Develop tooling similar to spelling and grammar checkers.

Ways you can contribute...

* Clean up harmful language in your own projects. 
* Encourage others to do the same in their projects. 
* Participate in the [Inclusive Naming Initiative](https://inclusivenaming.org/participate/).
