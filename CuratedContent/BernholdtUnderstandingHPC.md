This article comes from the perspective of trying to help software engineering (SWE) researchers understand the high-performance computing community.  Victor Basili and his students and collaborators are SWE researchers who have spent a significant amount of time working with the HPC community -- a relatively uncommon pursuit. The purpose of this article is to explain to the SWE community some of the ways in which the HPC community differs from other kinds of software development that are more commonly studied by SWE researchers.  It is also useful for HPC researchers and computational scientists to start to understanding how and why widely used (and often widely hyped) SWE methodologies might need to be adapted and tailored for use in HPC/computational science and engineering (CSE), or even might not be useful in the way that they are in other types of software development.  And it can give CSE researchers some insights into the interests of SWE researchers they might want to interact with.
