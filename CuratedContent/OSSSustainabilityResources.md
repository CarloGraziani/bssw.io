# A Collection of Resources for Sustaining Open Source Software

Are you a researcher or developer interested in sustaining open source software? This article gives resources that discuss challenges facing open source software maintainers, to organizations that provide community funding for open source projects.


Sustaining a scientific software project is a difficult task.  One
strategy for sustaining scientific software is to build a community of
open source contributors.  

This page documents resources available for maintainers of open source
software (OSS), from reports and books discussing the problems facing OSS
maintainers, to foundations and nonprofits that can potentially provide
community funding for open source projects.  Much scientific software is
open source, and the needs of mainstream open source projects frequently
overlap with those of the scientific community.  Better Scientific
Software encourages leveraging the wisdom of existing successful projects
to implement your sustainability plan.

Book title | Producing Open Source Software
Authors | Karl Fogel
Publication | 2005, ISBN-10: 0596007590, ISBN-13: 978-0596007591

The *Producing Open Source Software* book is authired by Karl Fogel in 2005. It discusses various aspects of managing a community of open source developers.

### Podcasts

* [Request for Commits](https://changelog.com/rfc) : A podcast about the human aspects of software development, focusing on
  software sustainability. It includes many interviews with leaders in major open
  source projects.

* [RCE Podcast](http://www.rce-cast.com/): A podcast that covers open source projects in HPC. It includes many interviews with
  maintainers, researchers, and developers of popular HPC software
  projects. It is run by Brock Palen (UMich) and Jeff Sqyres (Cisco).

### Foundations and nonprofits that fund open source development

* [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/): A501 (c) nonprofit sustaining open source projects in data science.

* [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/): A nonprofit technology trade association chartered to
  promote, protect, and advance Linux and collaborative development.

* [OpenHPC](https://openhpc.community) is a member project.


### Grants

* The [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov) offers
  funding for
  [Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (SI2)](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16532/nsf16532.htm)
  and has frequent calls for proposals.

* [DOE](https://energy.gov/) and other agencies work with the U.S.
  [SBIR Program](https://www.sbir.gov/) to help small businesses conduct
  R&D. The website provides information to starting companies on how to apply for SBIR funding, which is a potential way to
  productize and sustain an open source project started on research
  funds.  See the [ASCR SBIR page](https://science.energy.gov/sbir/) to
  get started.

* The [Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) and the
  [Moore Foundation](https://www.moore.org/) offer grants in science and
  technology, among other areas. They have funded large data science
  initiatives that support open source, such as the
  [Moore-Sloan Data Science Environments (MSDE)](http://msdse.org/) and
  the
  [Jupyter Project](https://blog.jupyter.org/new-funding-for-jupyter-12009a836867).

* The [Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org) has
  [grants](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/our-grants/) dedicated to
  fighting inequality. One thrust area is
  [technology for the public interest](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/challenging-inequality/),
  which funded the Roads & Bridges report on open source.
