# Working Effectively with Legacy Code

## Feathers, Michael, 2005

This is really the book that gives me hope that we can take very bad software and through targeted incremental unit testing and refactoring, can turn it into good software while implementing and delivering new functionality the whole time. This book is where the rubber meets the road combining unit testing and refactoring. If you read the book Refactoring by Martin Fowler and (like me) felt a little uneasy about how this would apply to large nasty software projects, then Working Effectively with Legacy Code is the book for you. Whatâ€™s more, Michael mentions and reviews many of the object-oriented principles in Agile Software Development as well as other little bits of information that you will find in the other books listed here. I really see this book as the logical culmination of the books Refactoring and Test Driven Development. This book is packed with practical examples that show you nearly every trick there is for refactoring nasty code to break dependencies and getting code into a unit test harness. By the time you are done reading this book if you are not shamed into doing unit testing then you have no business developing software. Before reading this book, I was not 100% convinced about unit testing. After reading this book, I unit test almost every non-trivial code as a rule and it has massively improved the quality of the software that I write. There is no going back for me.
