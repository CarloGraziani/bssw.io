# The HPC Best Practices Webinar Series

Do you want to know what it takes to put in place a series of webinars focusing on software development methodologies, 
tools and experiences to improve developer productivity and software sustainability? 
This article introduces a good resource for this purpose.

Scientific software teams are typically focused on the creation of a new set of features that will enable the next set of 
computational experiments.  Teams seldom have the time to stop development and focus solely on improving productivity or 
sustainability.  However, teams can incorporate improvements *on the way* to developing new science capabilities.

The Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) process recognizes that productivity and sustainability 
improvements for scientific software benefit from an incremental, iterative approach.  
The *[PSIP-Tools GitHub repo](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/PSIP-Tools)* 
is a collection of documents that enable the adoption and use of PSIP for a software team.  
The *PSIP-Tools* repo contains everything from a template for the first introduction letter to a 
complete interview guide, interview prompts and expected timeline.

The PSIP process has been successfully used to help scientific software teams acheive incremental, 
sustainable process improvement, while still achieving their science goals.
