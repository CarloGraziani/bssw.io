# Inclusive Language Resources
<!--deck text start-->
If we knew terms and phrases we commonly use such as, for example, *sanity check*,  *tipping point*, or *grandfathered* had the effect of normalizing or perpetuating historical systemic biases, would we still use them?

When fist stepping on the Moon, Armstrong said *"This is a small step for a **man** but a giant leap for **man**kind."*
Later that same Moonwalk, [he said](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/telephone-conversation-with-the-apollo-11-astronauts-the-moon), *"It is a great honor...to be here representing...**men** of peaceable nations, **men** with an interest and a curiosity, and **men** with a vision for the future."*
That sure doesn't read now nor did it sound at the time very much like space exploration included women.

Regardless of how common-place any manner of speaking or turn of phrase is or may have been for its time, the example demonstrates how the language we use can manifest bias and wind up excluding whole groups of people.
To help skeptics empathize, imagine if instead of a crew of all white, Christian men the first mission to Mars is crewed by all black, Muslim women and the first to walk on Mars says something like *"This is a small step for a woman but a giant leap for woman-kind...Allahu Akbar."*

As HPC/CSE software developers maybe we're not doing anything nearly as momentus as being the first Earthlings to walk on another planet.
Do we really need to worry so much about inclusive language?
If we care about our project's reach and maximizing our ability to attract and retain collaborators, developers, users or sponsors, then yes we do.
That is because the language we use has the power to welcome others in as well as push them away.

Software projects involve a lot of communication.
As developers, we write code, comments, documentation, research papers, presentations, job postings, promotional materials, discussion posts, emails, chats, tweets and more.
It is now well known that language used in [job postings](https://www.mya.com/blog/unconscious-bias-in-job-descriptions/) has the effect of biasing the respondent pool in undesireable ways.
The more we adopt inclusive language, the more we reduce biases and create welcoming and safe spaces for all participants to be their authentic selves, to be productive and to thrive.

Inclusive *naming* is closely related to inclusive language but focuses primarily on the naming of things.
That is the *names* we choose for abstract objects of our software systems.
A callenge with inclusive naming is that people tend to get pretty attached to names, often without any regard for accuracy, historical or otherwise.
Was Edmund Halley the first to observe and record [the comet](https://www.space.com/19878-halleys-comet.html) that bares his name?<sup>1</sup>
Certainly not.
Chinese astronomers [observed and recorded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_comet_observations_in_China#Halley's_Comet) it almost 2,000 years earlier.
Was Pythagoras the [first person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras#In_mathematics) ever to discover and write down the rule we know as the Pythagorean theorem?
Plenty of [scholarly research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337941217_Mathematics_in_Ancient_Egypt_Part_II) says he was not.

For many terms and phrases we commonly use, we are simply unconcsiously parroting others.
That can be dangerous if one is not mindful of the meaning, history or impact of a term.
Do any readers know why we call defects in software [*bugs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#History)?
How might a women feel reading documentation that constantly refers to the user as [*he*, *his* or *him*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/12/15/guide-how-gender-neutral-language-is-developing-around-world/)?
How might a black person feel reading that existing users will be [*grandfathered in*](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/21/239081586/the-racial-history-of-the-grandfather-clause) when the software license terms are changed?
How might a neuro-diverse person feel about being tasked to add [*sanity checks*](https://gist.github.com/seanmhanson/fe370c2d8bd2b3228680e38899baf5cc) to a software package's test suite?

By the way, do readers recognize any bias manifested in the preceding questions?
Its subtle but worth mentioning.
The way these questions are worded suggest that only women would care about documentation that is laden with male pronouns or that only black people would care about language derived out of oppresive practices or that only neuro-diverse people would care about language associated with a state of mind.
The truth is, we all (*should*) care.
And, to use language that suggests otherwise is, well, not inclusive.

There is no way to phrase something that will be acceptable to literally *every* individual.
And, there is no reason we should be aiming for that either.
Catering to any one individual's tastes and sensibilities is not what inclusive language is all about.
The goal of inclusive language is to reduce the use of terms and phrases that wind up uniformally *excluding whole groups* of people.
It is not about being politically correct or being the language police.
Its about being willing to acknowledge that certain terms and phrases (and, honestly, even names, icons and logos), however common in current culture, can be unnecessarily exclusive and being willing to consider and adopt alternatives that are less so.

Given the current social justice climate in which we all operate, some readers will feel that inclusive language efforts are nowhere near enough to meet the moment.
Others will feel like such efforts are way too much.
While we can acknowledge both prespectives, it is worth considering that when we're accustomed to parroting the status quo, striving for more inclusive language can feel like oppression.

Ever since adopting the practice myself, there isn't a week that goes by that I don't have the experience of questioning a term or phrase I am about to use.
I often spend a few minutes searching the web to learn more about it.
This includes terms and phrases I have used many times before without really thinking about it.
We hope the resources we have compiled here are useful to any readers who may be similarly inclined.
But, beware.
In seeking greater understanding of the history of terms and phrases you thought you knew, there is a lot of [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb) out there to sift through as well.

If you've read this far, you may be asking yourself, how do I get started?
I would suggest reading some of the resources offered here, especially [Plain Language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/), [Google inclusive style](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation), and [MicroSoft's Bias Free Communication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free-communication).
In particular, if you are looking for *tooling* to help find and correct inclusive language issues ([Joanna Lee](https://github.com/joannalee333), a colleague on the [Inclusive Naming Initiative](https://inclusivenaming.org/), calls these *inclusivity bugs*) in your project, some of the resources listed here provide some tooling.
That said, DevOps level tooling for inclusive language is still in its infancy stages.

<sup>1</sup>The comet is named for Halley because it is believed he was the first to have estimated its orbit and based on that connected recorded observations from 1531, 1607 and 1682 as being the same celestial object from which he correctly predicted its return in 1758.
