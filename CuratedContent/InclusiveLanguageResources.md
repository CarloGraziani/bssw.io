# Inclusive Language Resources
<!--deck text start-->
Phrases like *sanity check*,  *tipping point*, or *grandfathered in* are not unheard of in software projects.
If we knew such phrases had their roots in oppressive or genocidal history, or if we knew they had the effect of normalizing or perpetuating historical injustices, would we still use them?

When taking the first steps on the Moon, Armstrong said *"This is a small step for a **man** but a giant leap for **man**kind."*
Later that same Moonwalk, [he said](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/telephone-conversation-with-the-apollo-11-astronauts-the-moon), *"It is a great honor...to be here representing...**men** of peaceable nations, **men** with an interest and a curiosity, and **men** with a vision for the future."*

Regardless of how common-place any given turn of phrase is or may have been for its time, the example demonstrates how the language we use can wind up excluding whole groups of people.
To help skeptics empathize, imagine if the first mission to Mars is a crew of all Black, Muslim women and the first to set foot on Mars says something like *"This is a small step for a woman but a giant leap for woman-kind...Allahu Akbar."*

Ok, as HPC/CSE software developers maybe we're not doing anything nearly as momentus as being the first Earthlings to walk on another planet.
Do we really need to worry so much about inclusive language?
If we care about maximizing our project's ability to attract and retain potential collaborators, developers, users or sponsors, then yes we do.
That is because the language we use has the power to welcome others in as well as push them away.

Software projects involve a lot of communication.
As developers, we write code, comments, documentation, research papers, presentations, job postings, promotional materials, discussion posts, emails, chats, tweets and more.
It is now well known that language used in [job postings](https://www.mya.com/blog/unconscious-bias-in-job-descriptions/) has the effect of biasing the respondent pool in undesireable ways.
The more we adopt inclusive language, the more we reduce biases and create welcoming and safe spaces for all participants to be their authentic selves, to be productive and to thrive.

Inclusive *naming* is closely related to inclusive language but focuses primarily on the naming of things.
That is the *names* we choose for abstract objects of our software systems.
A callenge with inclusive naming is that people tend to get pretty attached to names, often without any regard for accuracy, historical or otherwise.
For example, was Pythagoras indeed the [first person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras#In_mathematics) ever to write down that famous and fundamental right-triangle rule?
There is plenty of [scholarly research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337941217_Mathematics_in_Ancient_Egypt_Part_II) that suggests he was not.

Do you know why we call it "Halley's Comet"?
Halley was not the first to observe or even record it.
Chinese astronomers [observed and recorded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_comet_observations_in_China#Halley's_Comet) it almost 2,000 years before Halley.
Halley, however, is believed to be the first to estimate its orbit and based on that estimation connect recorded observations from 1531, 1607 and 1682 as being the same object and then correctly predict its return in 1758.

Many terms and phrases we often use are simply unconcsiously following precedent set by others before us.
That can be dangerous if one is not mindful of either the meaning, history or impact of the term upon others.
Do any readers know why we call defects in software [*bugs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#History)?
How might a women feel reading documentation that constantly refers to the user as [*he*, *his* or *him*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/12/15/guide-how-gender-neutral-language-is-developing-around-world/)?
How might a black person feel reading that existing users will be [*grandfathered in*](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/21/239081586/the-racial-history-of-the-grandfather-clause) when the software license terms are changed?
How might a neuro-diverse person feel about being tasked to add [*sanity checks*](https://gist.github.com/seanmhanson/fe370c2d8bd2b3228680e38899baf5cc) to a software package's test suite?

Sometimes, there is no way to phrase something that will be acceptable to literally *every* individual.
Nor, should we be aiming for that.
Catering to any one individual's tastes and sensibilities is not what inclusive language is all about.
The goal of inclusive language is to reduce the use of terms and phrases that wind up uniformally *excluding whole groups* of people.
It is not about being politically correct or being the language police.
Its about being willing to acknowledge that poorly chosen terms and phrases, however common in current vernacular, can be unnecessarily exclusive and being willing to consider and adopt alternatives that are less so.

Ever since adopting the practice of being more inclusive in my own language, there isn't a week that goes by that I don't have the experience of questioning why I am about to write or speak a given phrase.
I often spend a few minutes searching the web to learn more about it (including terms and phrases I have used many times before I choose to either move ahead as planned or select different words.
We hope the resources we have compiled here are useful to anyone who is similarly inclined.
But, beware.
In seeking greater understanding of the history of terms and phrases you thought you knew, there is a lot of [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb) out there to sift through as well.
