# Inclusivity Bugs and the Language We Use
<!--deck text start-->
If we knew terms and phrases we commonly use such as, for example, *sanity check*,  *tipping point*, or *grandfathered* had the effect of normalizing or perpetuating historical systemic biases, would we still use them?

When fist stepping on the Moon, Armstrong said *"This is a small step for a **man** but a giant leap for **man**kind."*
Later that same Moonwalk, [he said](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/telephone-conversation-with-the-apollo-11-astronauts-the-moon), *"It is a great honor...to be here representing...**men** of peaceable nations, **men** with an interest and a curiosity, and **men** with a vision for the future."*

That sure doesn't read now nor did it sound at the time very much like space exploration included women.
[Joanna Lee](https://github.com/joannalee333), a contributor to the [Inclusive Naming Initiative](https://inclusivenaming.org/), calls the use of language that excludes whole groups of people like this *inclusivity bugs*.

Regardless of how common-place any manner of speaking or turn of phrase is or may have been for its time, the example demonstrates how the language we use can manifest bias and wind up excluding whole groups of people.
To help skeptics empathize, imagine if instead of a crew of all white, Christian men as the first Apollo mission was (maybe all Apollo missions), the first mission to Mars is crewed by all black, Muslim women and the first to walk on Mars says something like *"This is a small step for a woman but a giant leap for woman-kind...Allahu Akbar."*

As HPC/CSE software developers maybe we're not doing anything nearly as momentus as being the first Earthlings to walk on another planet.
Do we really need to worry so much about inclusive language?
If we care about our project's reach and maximizing our ability to attract and retain collaborators, developers, users or sponsors, then yes we do.
That is because the language we use has the power to welcome others in as well as push them away.

Software projects involve a lot of communication.
As developers, we write code, comments, documentation, research papers, presentations, job postings, promotional materials, discussion posts, emails, chats, tweets and more.
It is now well known that language used in [job postings](https://www.mya.com/blog/unconscious-bias-in-job-descriptions/) has the effect of biasing the respondent pool in undesireable ways.
The more we adopt inclusive language, the more we reduce biases and create welcoming and safe spaces for all participants to be their authentic selves, to be productive and to thrive.

Any readers who have written proposals likely already appreciate the role language plays in communicating about our work.
When writing proposals, we often struggle with and debate at length how individual word choices will have the effect of aligning our proposal with the sponsor's call.
In other words, we all already appreciate the importance of and can be quite mindful of language when funding is on the line.
Aiming to be inclusive in our language is no different.

Inclusive *naming* is closely related to inclusive language but focuses primarily on the naming of things.
That is the *names* we choose for abstract objects of our software systems.
A special callenge with inclusive naming is that people tend to get pretty attached to names, often without any regard for accuracy, historical or otherwise.
Was Edmund Halley the first to observe and record [the comet](https://www.space.com/19878-halleys-comet.html) that bares his name?<sup>1</sup>
Certainly not.
Chinese astronomers [observed and recorded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_comet_observations_in_China#Halley's_Comet) it almost 2,000 years earlier.
Was Pythagoras the [first person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras#In_mathematics) ever to discover and write down the rule we know as the Pythagorean theorem?
Plenty of [scholarly research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337941217_Mathematics_in_Ancient_Egypt_Part_II) says he was not.

For many terms and phrases we commonly use, we are simply unconcsiously parroting others.
That can be dangerous if one is not mindful of the meaning, history or impact of a term.
Do any readers know why we call defects in software [*bugs*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#History)?
How might a women feel reading documentation that constantly refers to the user as [*he*, *his* or *him*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/12/15/guide-how-gender-neutral-language-is-developing-around-world/)?
How might a black person feel reading that existing users will be [*grandfathered in*](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/10/21/239081586/the-racial-history-of-the-grandfather-clause) when the software license terms are changed?
How might a neuro-diverse person feel about being tasked to add [*sanity checks*](https://gist.github.com/seanmhanson/fe370c2d8bd2b3228680e38899baf5cc) to a software package's test suite?

By the way, do readers recognize any bias manifested in the preceding questions?
Its subtle but worth mentioning.
The way these questions are worded suggests that only women would care about documentation that is laden with male pronouns or that only black people would care about language derived out of racially oppresive practices or that only neuro-diverse people would care about language associated with a state of mind.
The truth is, we all (*should*) care.
And, to use language that suggests otherwise is, well, not inclusive.

There is no way to phrase something that will be acceptable to literally *every* individual.
And, there is no reason we should be aiming for that either.
Catering to any one individual's tastes and sensibilities is not what inclusive language is all about.
The goal of inclusive language is to reduce the use of terms and phrases that wind up uniformally *excluding whole groups* of people.
It is not about being politically correct or being the language police.
Its about being willing to acknowledge that certain terms and phrases (and, honestly, even names, icons and logos), however common in current culture, can be unnecessarily exclusive and being willing to consider and adopt alternatives that are less so.

If you've read this far, you may be asking yourself, how do I get started?
We suggest reading some of the resources listed here, especially [Plain Language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/), [Google inclusive style](https://developers.google.com/style/inclusive-documentation), and [MicroSoft's Bias Free Communication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/bias-free-communication).
In particular, if you are looking for *tooling* to help alert you to inclusive language issues, some of the resources listed here provide tooling as a web service.
That said, community standards and DevOps-hardened tooling for inclusive language is still in its infancy stages.

Ever since adopting the practice myself, there isn't a week that goes by that I don't have the experience of questioning a term or phrase I am about to use.
I often spend a few minutes searching the web to learn more about it.
This includes terms and phrases I have used many times before without really thinking about it such as describing an off-topic enhancement request as having gone [*off the reservation*](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/06/29/326690947/should-saying-someone-is-off-the-reservation-be-off-limits) or replying to it with [*no can do*](mentalfloss.com/article/625916/racist-origins-common-phrases) or introducing a colleague as a Python [*Guru*](https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/cultural-appropriation/) or Java [*Ninja*](https://www.yogajournal.com/lifestyle/cultural-appropriation/), or complaining my bug reports are [*falling on deaf ears*](https://www.hearinglikeme.com/is-the-phrase-falling-on-deaf-ears-offensive/) or that the level of effort is too many [*man-hours*](https://bossbetty.com/big-story/manpower-man-hours-and-other-phrases-to-ix-nay-from-your-iased-bay-vocabulary/).

We hope the resources we have compiled here are useful to any readers who may be similarly inclined.
But, beware.
In seeking greater understanding of the history of terms and phrases you thought you knew, there is a lot of [misinformation](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/magazine/on-language-misrule-of-thumb.html) out there to sift through as well.
In addition, when you are seeking to learn more about any possible negative impacts of a given word or phrase, its best to seek opinions from experts *within* the groups most likely impacted.
In other words, if a given phrase has potential negative impacts against blacks, then language experts within the black community will likely have the the most authoritative guidance.
If a given phrase has potential negative impacts against the deaf, then language experts within the deaf community will likely have the most informed guidance.

Finally, in seeking to fix inclusivity bugs, its important to take care that we don't introduce another kind of problem...excluding the use of perfectly acceptable language for no other reason than out of fear of looking bad or being labeled non-inclusive.
A good example is the word [*master*](https://www.etymonline.com/word/master) alone, apart from *slave*.
Hopefully, we all can agree that [*master/slave*](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-confronts-use-labels-master-slave/) language is not acceptable.

But, there is much less agreement, notably even within the black community, about the word *master* alone and with no relation to *slave*.
There are many uses of *master* that have no historical roots in oppresive or genocidal systems.
These include such terms as *mastermind*, *postmaster*, *master key*, *master recording*, achieving *mastery* of a skill and even common tech terms like *webmaster* and *scrum master*.
This issue garnered much attention when GitHub [announced](https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7qbyv/github-to-remove-masterslave-terminology-from-its-platform) it would change its *default* branch name (which most users simply adopt without question) from *master* to *main*.
In that move it is worth pointing out that the *default* language of a widely used resource such as `git` is a significantly greater proliferation potential and represents a qualitatively different situation than the choices individual projects make.
Furthermore, no project is prevented from using *master* as a `git` branch name if they choose.

Given the current social justice climate in which we all operate, some readers will feel that inclusive language efforts are nowhere near enough to meet the moment and are really just a [distraction](https://www.wired.com/story/tech-confronts-use-labels-master-slave/) from bigger issues.
Its hard to argue with that.
Nonetheless, others will feel like such efforts go way too far.
While we can acknowledge both prespectives exist, it is worth remembering that [when we're accustomed to parroting the status quo, pausing to be more inclusive feels like oppression](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/when-youre-accustomed-to-privilege_b_9460662).

<sup>1</sup>The comet is named for Halley because it is believed he was the first to have estimated its orbit and based on that connected recorded observations from 1531, 1607 and 1682 as being the same celestial object from which he correctly predicted its return in 1758.
