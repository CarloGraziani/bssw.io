# User Stories

User stories provide flexible means of conveying product requirements. 

The basic elements of a user story are 
*who*, *what*, *why*. There is certainly more than one way to format these, but several patterns are recommended 
(see [Crisp's blog article](https://blog.crisp.se/2014/09/25/david-evans/as-a-i-want-so-that-considered-harmful)). 
The most widely used pattern seems to be "As a \<role\>, I want \<capability\> so that \<why\>."

User stories encode client and user requirements, but are intended to be simple, not comprehensive, in order to 
spur conversation about further details and tradeoffs.  They also serve as a touch point for product development 
teams as efforts go forward.  Complex product design is inherently iterative, and early design choices may need 
to be revised and refined.  The simplicity of user stories and the omission of detail enables designers 
and developers flexibility as the product evolves through iterations.

The IDEAS-ECP project has been pursuing the user story approach to streamline the project’s activities and 
also to understand how user stories could support ECP software development efforts. For the purposes of the project,
the stories are classified as follows:
- *training and documentation*: stories related to specific needs for documentation and training, such
as the casual usage of services for version control, description of design patterns for version control,
design of specific training courses (e.g., on new features in a programming language), etc.
- *software integration and testing*: stories related to component integration and testing, software robustness,
multi-repository development, process to stress software functionalities under different compilation
scenarios, etc.
- *software quality*: stories related to updates on HPC architectures, continuous integration to enable
testing at DOE computing facilities, access to reliable tools (and examples) to support the improvement
of application performance, etc.
- *practice and standards*: stories related to the creation of team policies, coding standards, guidelines
on releasing, licensing, copyrighting, and managing software contributions, etc.
- *software requirements and development*: stories related to time-saving tips for developing better
software, improvement of design processes, introduction of code reviews for producing higher quality
software, etc.
- *operational*: stories related to the editorial workflow for BSSw (this website), interviews performed 
by the project, documenting and publicizing the project’s outreach activities, etc.
