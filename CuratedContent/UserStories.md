# User Stories

User stories provide flexible means of conveying product requirements.  The basic elements of a user story are 
*who*, *what*, *why*. There is certainly more than one way to format these, but several patterns are recommended 
(see [Crisp's blog article](https://blog.crisp.se/2014/09/25/david-evans/as-a-i-want-so-that-considered-harmful)). 
The most widely used pattern seems to be "As a \<role\>, I want \<capability\> so that \<why\>."
