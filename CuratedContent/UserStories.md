# User Stories

User stories provide flexible means of conveying product requirements.  The basic elements of a user story are 
*who*, *what*, *why*. There is certainly more than one way to format these, but several patterns are recommended 
(see [Crisp's blog article](https://blog.crisp.se/2014/09/25/david-evans/as-a-i-want-so-that-considered-harmful)). 
The most widely used pattern seems to be "As a \<role\>, I want \<capability\> so that \<why\>."

User stories encode client and user requirements, but are intended to be simple, not comprehensive, in order to 
spur conversation about further details and tradeoffs.  They also serve as a touch point for product development 
teams as efforts go forward.  Complex product design is inherently iterative, and early design choices may need 
to be revised and refined.  The simplicity of user stories and the omission of detail enables designers 
and developers flexibility as the product evolves through iterations.
