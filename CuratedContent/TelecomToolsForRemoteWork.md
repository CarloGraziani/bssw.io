### Features We Highlight

Various teleconferencing tools have a wide variety of features. This article is
not meant to cover all of them. Here, we focus only on features likely to be
relevant to the HPC/CSE community in a work-at-home setting.

### Laptop/Deskside Web Client Compatability

The web client typically allows users to join a meeting through their browser.
A web client is often advantageous because it *usually* allows users to avoid
having to install software on their machine. Sometimes, however, the user may
have to download a browser *extension* to support the web client. In addition,
web clients typically do not support *all* features.

### Recommended Browser

The *recommended* browser is either the browser that supports the *most*
features or is the one recommended by the vendor.

### Test Meeting

A test meeting is a useful way for you to test your particular setup to ensure
it works, at a basic level, with the software and service. You may not be able
to test *all* features but you should be able to test basic audio and video
support.

### Breakout Rooms

This is a feature that makes it possible for a single meeting to be broken into
sub-meetings among smaller groups of participants and, after a period of time,
re-joined back into the single large meeting.

### Voting or Polling

This is a feature that allows the host to ask participants a question and have then anonymously vote their responses.

### Screen Sharing

This is a feature that allows the host/presenter to share everything on his/her screen with all the participants. All teleconference tools support this feature. However, a number of tools also support variations of this feature for different needs. These are described below.

### App Sharing

App (or Application) sharing is like [*Screen Sharing*](#screen-sharing) except that the window(s) of only a single application (e.g. PowerPoint or Word) is shared.  The host/presenter is not forced to share their whole screen but can select only the window(s) from a specific application to share. This can be useful in cases where the host/presenter tends to have a lot of windows open and they want to keep the participants from accidentally seeing the contents of those other windows. When you have a choice, using application-specific sharing is a **best practice**.

### Shared Annotations

This is similar to but not quite the same thing as [*Screen Sharing*](#screen-sharing). Shared annotations allows the presenter/host to draw annotations on top of whatever content is being displayed in the main window so that all other participants can see it.

### Shared Whiteboard

This is similar to but not quite the same thing as *Shared Annotations*. A shared whiteboard is a separate drawing area, like a whiteboard in an office, where all participants can doodle content and paste images they captured locally.

### GoToMeeting

[GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com) is part of a larger line of products
including GoToTraining and GoToWebinar. We describe here only the features in
the GoToMeeting product. Some of the features are available in these other
products.
