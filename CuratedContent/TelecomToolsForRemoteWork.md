# Features Most Useful for HPC/CSE Remote Work

Various teleconferencing tools have a wide variety of features. This article is
not meant to cover all of them. Here, we focus only on features likely to be
relevant to the HPC/CSE community in a work-at-home setting *and* which have some
degree of variability in support across various products. In addition, many
providers offer a range of products, often by different names, suitable for use by
small teams all the way up to large organizations. Here, we focus on providing
information for the lower tier products and plans. In the table below...

* *Partial* means some support for the feature exists.
* *Maybe* means whether support for the feature exists or not depends on other factors.
* Footnotes (just the numbers as links) provide links to additional information.
* Letter codes: Hover over links to reveal balloon hints for meanings.

## Basic Features

### Pricing

Most vendors offer a *free* plan with length and/or size limitations. In response to the
current pandemic situation, some vendors have either lowered prices of their paid plans
or relaxed some limitations of their free plans.

Simply *attending* another host's meeting does not typically require a user to purchase a
plan. However, recent security concerns in some products may cause some meeting hosts to
adjust their meeting's security settings such that users are required to have an *account*
with the vendor before logging in and this in turn may require users to obtain a plan even
if only the free one.

If you do need to *host* meetings *and* you do not already have a plan through your home
orginization, the lowest-level paid plan in any of these products is probably sufficient
for most project's needs.

### Max Meeting Size

The *max meeting size* is the maximum number of *attendees* in a meeting. A number of
vendors draw a distinction between a *meeting*, which typically requires attendees to
*interact* with each other and a *webinar* where the majority of attendees are just
listening and viewing content. 

**Note**: Many people like to use a normal telephone call (cell, voip or landline) for
audio. When the do this and 

## Content Sharing

### Voting or Polling

This is a feature that allows the host to ask participants a question and have
them anonymously vote their responses. In the absence of this feature, a decent
work-around is using on-demand [Google forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/).

### Screen Sharing

This is a feature that allows the host/presenter to share everything on his/her screen
with all the participants. All teleconference tools support this feature even from 
mobile devices. However, a number of tools also support variations of this feature for
different needs. These are described below.

### App-only Sharing

App (or Application) sharing is like [*Screen Sharing*](#screen-sharing) except that
the window(s) of only a single application (e.g. PowerPoint or Word) is shared. The
host/presenter is not forced to share their whole screen but can select only the
window(s) from a specific application to share. This can be useful in cases where the
host/presenter tends to have a lot of windows open and they want to keep the
participants from accidentally seeing the contents of those other windows. When you
have a choice, using application-specific sharing is a **best privacy practice**.

### Shared Annotations

This is similar to but not quite the same thing as [*Screen Sharing*](#screen-sharing).
Shared annotations allows the presenter/host to draw annotations on top of whatever
content is being displayed in the main window so that all other participants can see it.

### Shared Whiteboard

This is similar to but not quite the same thing as *Shared Annotations*. A shared
whiteboard is a separate drawing area, like a whiteboard in an office, where all
participants can doodle content and paste images they captured locally.

## Security

### Best Practices

For each product, there is a collection of *best practices* for ensuring the
highlest level of security for a meeting.

### Lock Meeting

When a meeting is *locked*, that means it cannot be joined by any other
participants even with the correct credentials. Participants that leave
a locked meeting cannot re-join either.

### Expel Attendee

*Expeling* or *removing* an attendee is typically a power that only meeting
hosts have. It is important for hosts to know how to do this *quickly*. If for
some reason the meeting is *bombed*, quick action from the host can correct
the situation before it gets out of hand.

### Expel Recovery

In most products, an attendee is expelled, they cannot ever again rejoin that
meeting instance. They have to use a wholly different *identity* or email
address or. So, it is important for hosts to take care when taking the drastic
action of expelling an attendee. Some products do enable a host to *recover*
from this situation however allowing an inadvertently expelled attendee to
rejoin with the same identity.

### Encryption


### Laptop/Deskside Web Client Compatability

The web client typically allows users to join a meeting through their browser.
A web client is often advantageous because it *usually* allows users to avoid
having to install software on their machine. Sometimes, however, the user may
have to download a browser *extension* to support the web client. In addition,
web clients often **do not** support features needed by a meeting *host* or
*presenter*. They are available primary to support meeting *attendees* only.

### Recommended Browser

The *recommended* browser is either the browser that supports the *most*
features or is the one recommended by the vendor.

### Test Meeting

A test meeting is a useful way for you to test your particular setup to ensure
it works, at a basic level, with the software and service. You may not be able
to test *all* features but you should be able to test basic audio and video
support.

### Breakout Rooms

This is a feature that makes it possible for a single meeting to be broken into
sub-meetings among smaller groups of participants and, after a period of time,
re-joined back into the single large meeting.

##### Zoom Notes

* (a) Maximum number of attendees depends on plan. There is a *Large Meeting*
add-on option to purchase, on a month-to-month basis, to expand the maximum up
to 1000. There is also a *Webinar* add-on option to purchase, on a month-to-month
basis, to expand to up to 10,000 *view-only* participants.
* (b) Zoom's free plan is limited to 40 minutes.

##### WebEx Notes

* (a) A number of factors may effect a WebEx meeting's maximum number of participants.
WebEx meetings can have up to 1,000 *interactive* partcipants and up to 3,000 *view-only*
participants. Meeting capacity varies a lot by product
and by how a site administrator has configured things.

* It appears *expelled* attendees may rejoin as long as the meeting is not [*locked*](#lock-meeting).

##### GoToMeeting Notes

* [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeeting.com) is part of a larger line of products
including GoToTraining and GoToWebinar. We consider here only the features in
the GoToMeeting product. Some features not availabe in GoToMeeting are available
in these other products.
