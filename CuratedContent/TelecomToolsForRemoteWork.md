### Breakout Rooms

This is a feature that makes it possible for a single meeting to be broken into sub-meetings among smaller groups of participants and, after a period of time, re-joined back into the single large meeting.

### Voting or Polling

This is a feature that allows the host to ask participants a question and have then anonymously vote their responses.

### Screen Sharing

This is a feature that allows the host/presenter to share everything on his/her screen with all the participants. All teleconference tools support this feature. However, a number of tools also support variations of this feature for different needs. These are described below.

### App Sharing

App (or Application) sharing is like [*Screen Sharing*](#screen-sharing) except that the window(s) of only a single application (e.g. PowerPoint or Word) is shared.  The host/presenter is not forced to share their whole screen but can select only the window(s) from a specific application to share. This can be useful in cases where the host/presenter tends to have a lot of windows open and they want to keep the participants from accidentally seeing the contents of those other windows. When you have a choice, using application-specific sharing is a **best practice**.

### Shared Annotations

This is similar to but not quite the same thing as [*Screen Sharing*](#screen-sharing). Shared annotations allows the presenter/host to draw annotations on top of whatever content is being displayed in the main window so that all other participants can see it.

### Shared Whiteboard

This is similar to but not quite the same thing as *Shared Annotations*. A shared whiteboard is a separate drawing area, like a whiteboard in an office, where all participants can doodle content and paste images they captured locally.
