The [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language is a flexible dynamic language, appropriate for scientific and numerical computing, with performance comparable to traditional statically-typed languages.

There are a number of important details in *finalizing* a Julia package in preparation for making it available for others to use. Some of the important steps needed are to ensure that the package is re-tested, coverage is re-computed and documentation is re-generated with each update to the package. This article is a good resource on this topic. The author, @ChrisRackauckas, goes into the details of key steps in the process including tips and tricks for `travis.yml` and `appvoyer.yml` files to run version compatability tests, update coverage and documentation.
