# Putting The HPC Best Practices Webinar Series in Motion

Do you want to know what it takes to put in place a series of webinars focusing on software development 
methodologies, tools and experiences to improve developer productivity and software sustainability? 
In this note we introduce the *machinery* behind the 
[HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) Webinars Series](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars).

The [HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) Webinars Series](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars)
is a vehicle for disseminating information related to scientific software, and to address productivity challenges. The 
series delivers contents ranging from software refactoring and testing, impacts of changes in computer architectures, 
to software performance and licensing. Apart from the selecion ot topics and speakers in a timely manner, one needs 
to follow a significant number of steps to lead a webinar to completion.

The [How to produce a webinar series](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/How-To-Produce-a-Webinar-Series)
repository describes the process we follow for the HPC-BP Series. While the series works in concert with
DOE's [Exascale Computing Project (ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org), the process can be refined and
adapted as needed (and applied to other scenarios). For example, over time we have found necessary to start 
interacting with speakers earlier, and adjust timelines accordingly.

The process described in the repository has been successful in delivering 26 webinars since June 2017, with an 
average of 79 participants per webinar.
