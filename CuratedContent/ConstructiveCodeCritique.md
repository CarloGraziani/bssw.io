The article [Constructive Code Critique](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2017-05-11-constructive-code-critique) from the UK Software Sustainabilty Institute (SSI) provides advice for reviewing code.  

The authors address what to do before, during and after the review.  They also provide advice about how to introduce this well-established and valuable practice into scientific software communities, where the practice may not be well understood.
