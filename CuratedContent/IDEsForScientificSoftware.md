# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Scientific Sofware Development

IDEs have been used extensively for software development for many years, and in most software engineering domains, 
are considered best practice. However, their uptake for scientific software development, and in particular, high
performance computing (HPC), has been much slower. Nevertheless, IDEs are quite widely used, particularly where software
engineering professionals are actively involved in the development of scientific software.
