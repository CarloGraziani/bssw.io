# Documentation Tools

Documentation is critical for establishing a contract for how software is
interacted with.  Introductory information:

- [What is good documentation?](WhatIsGoodDocumentation.md)
- [How to write good documentation](HowToWriteGoodDocumentation.md)

A variety of tools exist for writing, rendering, and managing documentation.

**Subresources:**
- Doxygen
- ReadTheDocs
- Sphinx
