[Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html) is a free and open
source tool that processes markup describing classes, functions, and variables
in your software's header files and generates a user-friendly hyperlinked set
of web pages.  These web pages allow the user to navigate all the classes,
functions, and variables and see 1) class hierachy relationships; 2) input and
output parameters for methods and functions; and 3) other variables and
associated data.

Doxygen supports many programming languages, and can also generate a
LaTeX-generated PDF file.
