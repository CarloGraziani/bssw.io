# Compuational Science Stack Exchange

[Computational Science Stack Exchange](https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/) is a question and answer site for scientists using computers to solve scientific problems.

The charter for this particular Stack Exchange site is buch broader than just software engineering, productivity, sustainability, and related topics.  Most of the questions tend to be more about methods and algorithms for computational science and engineering, but more software-oriented questions do arise.
