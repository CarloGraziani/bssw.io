# Putting The HPC Best Practices Webinar Series in Motion

Do you want to know what it takes to put in place a series of webinars focusing on software development 
methodologies, tools and experiences to improve developer productivity and software sustainability? 
In this note we introduce the *machinery* behind the 
[HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) Webinars Series](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars).

The [HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) Webinars Series](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars)
is a vehicle for disseminating information related to scientific software, and for addressing productivity challenges. The 
series aims at delivering contents ranging from software refactoring and testing, potential impacts of advances in computer 
architectures, to software performance and licensing. Apart from the selecion ot topics and speakers in a timely manner, 
it is important to follow a (rather large) number of steps to lead a webinar to completion.

The [How to produce a webinar series](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/How-To-Produce-a-Webinar-Series)
repository describes the process we follow for the HPC-BP Series. While the series works in concert with
DOE's [Exascale Computing Project (ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org), the process can be refined and
adapted as needed, as well as applied to other scenarios. For example, over time we found necessary to start 
interacting with speakers earlier, and adjust timelines accordingly.

The process described in the repository has been successful in delivering 26 webinars since June 2017, with an 
average of 79 participants per webinar.
