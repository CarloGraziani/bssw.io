The minisymposium "Improving Productivity and Sustainability for Parallel Computing Software", held at the [SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (PP20)](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/program/pp20), focused on technical, practical, and social challenges in software productivity, quality, and sustainability, with a goal of helping develop better and long-living, cutting-edge parallel computing software that can fulfill its designated roles in emerging exascale ecosystems. 

A collection of talks, that were presented at the minisymposium, have been collated and can be found on [Figshare](https://figshare.com/collections/SIAM_PP20_Minisymposium_Improving_Productivity_and_Sustainability_for_Parallel_Computing_Software/4934688). The mimisymposoium features several interesting presenters, representing Leadership Computing Facilities as well as well-known scientific projects. Below is a comprehensive list of the presenters and the covered topics.

* [Dr. Judith Hill](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/directory/staff-member/judith-hill/) spoke on the topic of software sustainability from a [Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/) perspective.
* [Dr. Sunita Chandrasekaran](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~schandra/) shared thoughts on training and best practices required to develop portable yet performant code.
* [Michal Habera](https://github.com/michalhabera) highlighted some of the top changes that have been carried out with respect to the sustainability of the [FEniCS Project](https://fenicsproject.org/).
* [Dr. Mark Gates](http://www.icl.utk.edu/~mgates3/) discussed sustainability lessons that emerged from the [SLATE Project](https://www.slateproject.org/).
* [Dr. Anshu Dubey](https://www.anl.gov/profile/anshu-dubey) shared experiences with productivity and software sustainability on the [Argonne Leadership Computing Facility](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/)
* [Dr. Benjamin Pritchard](http://molssi.org/molssi-software-scientist-dr-benjamin-pritchard/) focused on challenges and best practices in the Computational Molecular Sciences domain
* [Dr. Kenneth Jansen](https://www.colorado.edu/aerospace/kenneth-jansen) shared Software Sustainability Lessons from the Fluid Dynamics Community
* [Dr. David Moulton] focused on Productivity and Sustainability in a Community-Driven Software Ecosystem for [Watershed Science](https://ideas-productivity.org/ideas-watersheds/)

Overall, through the talks at the minisymposium - one can gain a good insight on challenges encountered and progress made towards software sustainability in some of the well-known areas of scientific HPC field.
