# Aggregate Resource Sample: Section X

This is a sample "section" file for an aggregate resource for the Better Scientific Software site.  Provide general introductory text for the topic in a separate "base" file and then information on various subtopics in separate "section" files. Use the following metadata to describe the aggregate resource components:

"base" for aggregate resource:  
- Aggregate: Base: [NameOfAggregateResourceBaseFile].md

Subtopic resource files:
- Aggregate: Base: [NameOfAggregateResourceBaseFile].md
- Aggregate: Section: [number of section in the aggregate, e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...]

The front-end for the BSSW site will combine the information into an aggregate resource as follows:
 - Aggregate: Base
 - Aggregate: Section 1
 - Aggregate: Section 2
 - Aggregate: Section 3
 - Etc.
