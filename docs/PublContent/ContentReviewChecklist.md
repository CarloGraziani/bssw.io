## Checklist for review of content types
This is a work-in-progress review checkist for all content that goes on the BSSw site. This document is to be used when we are ready with the content and need a final review of the document before publishing it.

Content is of three major types on BSSw: (1) Events, (2) Curated content and (3) Original Article. We discuss the review checklist for these three types of content.

## Expected Completed Common Checks 
Following is a list of checks that need to be done before the article reaches the final review stage. These checks are common to all content. Its expected that these checks are completed before we reach the "ready for publish" stage:

- [] Topic is of interest to readers
- [] Relevance of the article
- [] Judging whether an article idea is appropriate for BSSw - This is done when the topic is in backlog column
- [] Judging the actual content of a contribution i.e PR is acceptable or not - This needs to be done by the reviewers
- [] Judging whether content is ready for publication - This "content" needs to be done by the reviewers but the auxillary things can be done following this current document.
- [] Document follows style guide

--------------------------------------------------

## A Checklist for Common Review Criteria
Once the document is ready for review, there are some checks that will be common across all the content types. The following is a list of such common review criteria
- [] Spell checks, grammar, punctuation and syntax
- [] Hyperlinks and their validity
- [] Gender neutrality checking
- [] Check "Tone" of the article and whether it fits BSSw policies (its assumed that the article was judged appropriate for BSSw and has hence reached this stage)
- [] Reference checking
- [] Title format (what is bold?, capitalized?)
- [] Deck format
- [] Logos/images formatting (where possible, utilize images that express diversity)
- [] Image copyright permissions
- [] Check if professional proof-reading required. If yes, initiate and follow-through the entire proecedure
- [] Check if it conforms to .md requirements of bssw.io frontend website and not just github
- [] Category list (what category will the resource fall under?)
- [] Check is tags are set properly for displaying (these are usually at the bottom of the article)
- [] Check the document against the preview site
- [] We need to have something of the format "By checking this box, author acknowledges and agrees to licensing terms of content they develop here".
